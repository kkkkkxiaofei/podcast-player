      "Maria: Do you like making plans?Rory: Yeah, I love a plan. Maybe not the execution so much, but I like organising everything and putting it in place, so well, everything is ready. It makes me feel safe knowing everything has been accounted for.Maria: Do you always make plans?Rory: I try to, yeah. Sometimes it's fun to have a random day trip or something like that. But for the most part, I like to know what I'm doing and when, since I'm a very orderly person.Maria: And what do you usually plan?Rory: Oh, I think I have a plan for everything. I plan my day so that it goes as productively as possible. And I plan my lessons so they're effective and efficient. And I like making plans for my finances and things like that. So I always have money to do what I want to do.Maria: What are the benefits of making plans?Rory: I mean, well, they're pretty much endless. Financially speaking, if you have a plan, then you can use your money effectively than just spending it on the go or as it comes in. Then there's the almost psychological security of having everything in order. I think those are the two that stand out the most for me when I'm putting plans together.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: So, dear listener, we make plans. Remember, we talked about making lists? So make a list and make a plan. Plan out your life. And Rory is the most organised person on this planet. Definitely the most organised person I know.Rory: I try to be. It doesn't always work, unfortunately.Maria: So you can say, I love a plan. So I just love making plans or I dislike making plans. We make a plan and then we execute a plan. So here the execution means how your plan works in real life. So the execution, it's not about the killing in this context, but the act of doing something that you've planned out. So, the execution of my plan.Rory: You put the plan into action.Maria: Yeah, and the verb would be: execute my plan. Put it into action. You can say that I like organising everything. I like putting everything in place. Synonyms for making plans, organising - putting things in place. And I enjoy getting everything ready. It makes me feel safe. It makes me less nervous. It makes me feel less anxious. So usually we're anxious when we don't know what's going to happen. I tend to always make plans, or you can say I usually make plans. I don't make plans for everything, but for most things, I do have a plan. And sometimes I'm spontaneous. So I enjoy having a random day trip, which hasn't been planned. So, just like I enjoy a random trip once in a while. I plan everything, or I plan only my working affairs. Or you plan your trips, or I plan my day. I plan every day of my life. I plan my holidays. What do you plan, dear listener? I plan my shopping. I have a plan of my life. So I plan my day because I want it to be productive. And I plan my work to be effective and efficient. So when we make plans, we are efficient because we do stuff. We are productive.Rory: I feel like that's the only thing that we can say about the reasons why we make plans. It's either about being productive or effective and efficient. I can't think of anything else.Maria: Yeah, but also it's our emotional stability. As you've told us, a plan makes us feel safe. So it kind of removes our anxiety and nervousness. So if you have a plan, you're more confident and tend to be less worried. We make plans for something. So, usually people make plans for their finances. And you can say that I like making plans for my finances. So to plan out my finances, to plan out my budget, where I spend money, or on what. The benefits of making plans are endless, right, dear listener? There are endless benefits of making plans. Financially speaking, if you plan out your finances, then you can use your money effectively. Yay! If you don't have a plan for your money, you will spend money on the go. You will spend money spontaneously. Like, bam, you bought five books on Amazon, and all books are by Rory. Or bam, you bought our podcast without any ads. Then bam, you bought our phrasal verbs course. Bam, you bought Rory's classes.Rory: All of these, of course, are purchases you should be making.Maria: Yeah, yeah, you should make a plan for these purchases. Then there's psychological security, dear listener. Okay, so when you have everything in order, psychologically, it's better for you. When you put plans together, Rory, so like to make a plan or put a plan together, is it the same thing?Rory: Yeah, I think so. When we put a plan together, we make a plan. Maybe when we put things in order, that's about organising the actual material itself.Maria: And Rory, you write down plans in your diary, right? So like a book of your life.Rory: Yeah, or you write down plans in a planner.Maria: Yeah, in a planner, yeah, but it's like offline. I mean, you don't write online, but you use an actual book.",

I do like to go into schools from time to time, though. It's good to move around to classrooms and interact in real life from time to time.M: Do you prefer to work alone or in a group?R: Usually alone, I feel like I get more done that way. When you work in a group, there's always someone who does more and people who do less, and I'm almost always the one that works the hardest, and I really don't like that. Similarly, coordinating with others can be a real drag, because, well, someone always lets the side down.M: What part of your workplace or study place do you like the most?R: I love my desk. It's a standing desk, so I can change its elevation at the touch of a button. That's really good when I want to sit down for work or stand. I'm a bit worried about my posture these days, so it's good to have options.M: What's your favourite place to study?R: I like my couch for that. It's quite comfy, so I usually just curl up there with my books or my laptop and get down to business. It's a big open space with lots of pillows, so you can really relax there.",

      "M: Hey, dear listener! So a place of work or a place of study. You should decide to talk about a place where you work or a place where you study. Well, you can say that you do both. You work and you study there. We work at home, or we study at home, or we work in the workplace or in the office. Okay? Articles. In the office. Or you work at work.R: But some of us work from home.M: Yeah, true. I work from home, and then you can say I work in the kitchen, or I work in the bedroom. If I work when I'm in bed, Rory, what do I say? Like I'm just, I wake up and I work.R: I am lazy.M: No, but I do some work. But just in bed, lying down.R: I work remotely?M: No, but if I'm physically in bed. So do I say I work from bed?R: Oh, well, you can work from your bed.M: Okay. You can say I really like working from home, or I enjoy studying at home, and then explain why I don't follow a dress code. So I just...R: Yes.M: I may not even put anything on at all. Just naked, you know, at home.R: Oh, look at you, Maria, talking about nudity, if any of that's going in the episode.M: I can keep my own schedule or timetable. So I create my own schedule and I stick to it.R: And if you stick to your schedule, then you keep to your schedule, or you follow your schedule.M: Or you can say that I enjoy working in an office, because it gets me more organized. I get to chat with my colleagues. We can work or study alone or in a group. To study or work alone? You can also say to work by myself or to work on my own, on my own. I prefer to study on my own. And Rory usually studies and works alone. Why? Because I get more things done. So to get things done? When you do certain things. So I get more done if I study or work alone. I'm usually the one who works the hardest, so I'm usually the one who does all the hard work. So you can say I don't enjoy working in a group, because I usually work hard, and other people just like, do less, do less work. So the phrase is, I'm always the one, like the person, that works the hardest. Yeah... What does it mean if you say it's a real drag?R: Just that it doesn't do good things for your mood. So if something is a drag, it puts you in a bad mood.M: Yeah. Or, for example, you can say, like, oh, working alone is a drag. It's kind of like, I don't want to do it.R: What other things are a drag?M: A film, a film could be a drag. What a drag! Like it moves slowly. There's nothing going on. It's boring. It's a drag.

I read a book that said it was really bad for your posture and your general health, so I tried to stand wherever possible.M: Where's your favorite place to sit?R: Oh, well, I'm sort of in two minds about this, because I love my couch, I have a big three seater in my living room, and I love to sit and chill there for a bit. But I also have this ergonomic chair for my office, and that's pretty comfortable too, so it's great for work.M: Do you find it easy to fall asleep when sitting on a sofa?R: I certainly didn't used to, but I've got to throw for it for Christmas. So it's so cozy that sometimes I just curl up under it and drift off.M: When you were a child, did you usually sit on the floor?R: I think so. Maybe if we were short on space, but generally, we usually had enough room to share couches and seats.M: Do you feel sleepy when you are sitting down?R: Well, not as a matter of course, but sometimes, if I'm on a bus and they turn up the heating, it's hard to stay conscious. Or maybe if I've been on a flight for several hours, I could drift off in a seated position. But I hate that, since I always wake up feeling extremely stiff and it's not particularly comfortable.",
    discussion:
      "M: Right, dear listener, you know, it could be a funny topic, but actually, healthy sitting is important. Yes, dear listener, we should sit in a healthy way. Like correct sitting, healthy sitting, because we do spend a lot of time sitting down in the car, on a plane, at the office, dear listener. Prepositions are crazy. In the car, on a plane, at the office or at home. Rory, what about a chair? Do I sit on a chair? At a chair? In a chair?R: Well, you can sit in a chair, is usually what I would say, but you can also sit on something like a stool or a table.M: Bed.R: Or a bed.M: Yeah, sit on my bed. Okay? What about armchair?R: Oh, you sit in an armchair, actually, don't you? But you can sit on the arm of an armchair.M: Floor.R: You sit on the floor.M: Yeah. Right, dear listener, learning how to sit correctly is important for your mental well-being and for your posture, posture. Posture is the way you hold your shoulders and your back. So it's interesting, huh. Rory, have you ever heard of healthy sitting?R: Yes, I have, because I've been reading a lot about yoga recently, so I know all about healthy sitting.M: Like, what's the best way to sit?R: Well, ideally, on top of your sitting bones with your head in alignment with your, well, with your neck and your back. That's quite good for you. Relaxed shoulders.M: Also, dear listener, you can say that I spend a lot of time sitting while I commute to work. While I travel to work. Sitting down for a long time is bad for your posture. Posture is the way again you kind of, you hold your back. So you can say that I usually try to stand when possible. A very good expression is, I'm in two minds about this. So I am not sure. I have different answers. So what's your favorite place to sit? You know, I'm in two minds about this, I'm not sure. I love my couch. Like a sofa. And also, I have this... Chair. What kind of chair do you have, Rory?R: An ergonomic chair. It's a chair that's designed for efficiency and comfort in the workplace.M: Yeah. If you have two places, you can say, I'm in two minds about this. I love my bed, but also I have this ergonomic chair. Yeah. And you can say that I just chill there. Chill, like unwind, relax. I chill there for a bit, like on my couch.

I love having a really active life and learning about new things.M: Did you have any hobbies when you were a child?R: I'm not sure if you can call it a hobby, since I wasn't very principled about it, but I did like collecting these small plastic models of different military vehicles. That was cool. As for other hobbies, maybe reading, if that counts.M: Do you have a hobby that you've had since childhood?R: Well, I've always been a big fan of reading, though I try and vary it a bit more than I used to. Apart from that, I think all of the things I do now are radically different to what I did before.M: Do you have the same hobbies as your family members?R: Not really. We're all pretty diverse in that regard. For example, my brother is a pretty good cook, but I hate experimenting in the kitchen. One of my other brothers collects Lego, but I don't have the time or the patience for that. We do have something is in common, though, we all love reading, for example.M: Hey!

I think I'm very boring.M: Hmm. So usually people don't use the word hobby. Okay? They say, like, what do you like? What do you do in your free time? Like, what else do you ask? I'm into reading.R: What are you into? What do you get up to when you're not working?M: Yeah. So you can talk about like, I enjoy, I'm into, I'm into climbing, I'm into swimming.

If you're asked to compare or your childhood to now or talk about your childhood, I think that should be like a used to alarm and immediately just be like, I used to do this.M: Absolutely, dear listener. It's a common question. Like did you... When you were a child? Bam, used to. You don't do it anymore. So you can say, I used to go swimming, I used to go dancing, but not anymore.R: Even in the negative way, I didn't used to do blah, blah, blah, as much as I do now. For example, I didn't used to exercise as much as I do now, for sure.M: Correct. I did like collecting plastic models of military vehicles, military cars, tanks, some other vehicles, and you can say like I did like collecting, like I really liked collecting. Or I used to collect small models of something. Or I used, I used to collect coins. I used to go dancing. Or you can just lie about it. Then Present Perfect, maybe you are still collecting these coins. So I've been collecting coins since childhood. Present Perfect Continuous, actually.R: I've been collecting coins in my bank account. My hobby is saving money.M: Or I've been into dancing since childhood. So you started dancing when you were a child. You were doing it, and still you are, you enjoy dancing.

Rory story. Rory, tell me a story.R: I'll save that for speaking part two.M: Exactly. So do you like stories? You know, like, yes? Like, I mean, who doesn't, right? And you can ask this question, which is not actually a question. It's kind of like, who doesn't like stories? Like, everybody loves a good story, right? And Rory tells us, like, I mean, doesn't everyone? Kind of doesn't everybody like a story, a good story? So it's okay. Like, doesn't everyone? And everyone has, everyone loves, so everyone is like he or she, okay? That's why we say, doesn't everyone like stories? Not don't everyone, doesn't everyone. What's escapism? Escapism?R: That's very true. What is escapism? I know what it means, but if I had to define it in a sentence, what would I say?M: An educated native speaker, go, go, go.R: It's like an escape from the boring parts of life. So you sort of escape into these fantasy worlds.M: Exactly. Escapism, okay? From escape. A way of avoiding an unpleasant or boring life, especially by thinking, reading, watching some movies, listening to IELTS Speaking for Success podcast, premium. The link is in the description. About more exciting but impossible activities. So you watch, think or read about something exciting, usually impossible. For example, adventure movies are pure escapism, all right? Or, for many people, going on holiday is a form of escapism, all right? Rory, give us another sentence with escapism. Escapism.R: It's only really used for talking about stories.M: But books, books, movies?R: I indulge in a little bit of escapism every day because I read every day.M: But what about scrolling? If we go on Instagram, on Facebook, so is it a form of escapism?R: Um...M: No?R: I suppose it could be, although escapism is about delving into a fantasy world really. Supposedly, social media is about real people. But that's a matter for debate, I suppose.M: Yeah, so a very good point. So if you use this word, escapism, you kind of escape real life, and you go to a fantasy world. For example, the Lord of the Rings, The Game of Thrones, and you are just there. You are in this fantasy world, impossible things, but not in real life. Okay. We can read, listen to stories, and here we can talk about audio books, which are becoming more and more popular these days. For me, for example, I listen to books. I rarely read anything. I prefer to listen to books. So you can say that I like reading. I like reading stories. I enjoy listening to stories, to audio books and podcasts. So there are stories in different podcasts. And when does Rory listen to audiobooks and stories? When he was doing things at the gym.R: Or as background noise while I'm working here.M: Yeah, you can say that I enjoy listening to stories as background noise while I'm working. Okay? So you're working, and somewhere in the background there are people speaking English or Japanese. For some people, it's really disturbing, so they can't do it. But if you are at the gym or if you are doing some housework, so why not have some background noise?R: I don't think most people can. I think you probably tune it out when you're or as you're working.M: Yeah. But some people prefer to listen to music, right?R: Yeah. But again, if you're focused on a task, do you really enjoy the music in the same way?",

So I'm not sure if it's a gift or just something that I built up over time.M: Do you think anyone in your family has the same talent?R: Well, my dad has a great head for different facts about the world. Honestly, he's like a human encyclopedia. And I'm a little bit like that myself. And of course, my brother and my mother are quite gifted in the kitchen, so they share that trait as well.M: Do you think your talent can be useful for your future work?R: I mean, well, being a teacher usually calls for being reasonably well organized, but it's not the be-all and end-all. You also need to be good at talking to people and forming relationships. I like to think I'm rather adept at those too. But who isn't going to say that?M: Have you mastered it recently or when you were young?R: Well, it's definitely more of a recent development than something I did when I was younger. It's definitely something I'd say I've built up over time, and I wasn't very organized when I was younger. I didn't used to be. Also, although other skills that have been blunted are, like my drawing ability, I used to be really good at drawing, but that particular skill has been blunted now, so I suppose that's the trade-off for being better organized.",
    discussion:
      "M: Yay, talents! So we are talented, dear listener, and we have a talent for something, right?R: Yeah.M: Yeah, I have a talent for music or I have a talent for cooking. I'm talented.R: You do have a talent for music. You can play the ukulele.M: Yeah, or you can say I am a multi-talented person, I have lots of talents. Like, I'm a multi-talented singer and musician.R: Nice.M: We can also say I'm very good at cooking. I'm very good at languages. And Rory's talent is being phenomenally well organized. So as you know, dear listener, Rory is super organized, like band 9 organized, band 15 organized.R: I don't know if that counts as a talent, though.M: Yeah, it is a talent. I'm phenomenally well organized, like exceptional, like really super organized. Or you can say I'm phenomenally good at driving. I'm good at cooking, all right? I'm good at writing essays. You can say that I'm gifted, like you were born with it, for example. Or you can say, I'm not sure it's a gift, or it is a real gift that I have. So I'm very good at sports, and this is my gift. I'm gifted, or you can say that I've built it up over time. So you're born and you are not well organized, and you're just like bit by bit, you live your life and you train yourself to be well organized. So you can say, I've built it up over time. So we can build something up over time or over the years. Another synonym for being talented is to have a great head for something. For example, Rory's dad has a great head for different facts. So to have a head for something. What about your brother?R: Well, he's a dab hand in the kitchen, I suppose. So is my mom. But then this is compared to me, I'm completely useless in the kitchen. So you could say that they're quite gifted in the kitchen. They're good at cooking.M: Yeah, like she's quite gifted in the kitchen, or she's good at cooking. What else can I have a head for?R: I've only heard it used to describe facts and numbers, but that could also relate to things like knowledge about sports, but that's still facts. I'm trying to think, what else you could have a great head for? I'm sure there are other examples. I just can't think of any. If you don't have a great head, you could have a good eye for something, which means you're good at noticing patterns, for example.M: Have a good head for something, to have a natural ability to do something. And usually, we say it about numbers, about mathematics, about facts. So he has a head for numbers. Can I say, like, I don't have a headphone numbers?R: Yes, although we were talking about what people are talented at this time.M: And people who are very good at numbers and facts, you can say that they are walking encyclopedias, or like, he's like a human encyclopedia, full of different facts. And you can say my parents are quite gifted in the kitchen. They're super good at cooking. Or I'm gifted in the kitchen. Rory, you've used a good idiom. It's not the be-all and end-all.R: Yes, it's not the most important thing. So it's good to be well organized, but it's not the only thing that you need.M: The be-all and end-all. The most important thing. For example, winning is not the be-all and end-all. Winning in a competition is not the most important thing. There are other important things, usually.",

Like what do you call a party for boys before a wedding?R: A stag party?M: Yeah. A stag party. Or a hen, a hen party for ladies before the woman gets married. Only for ladies.R: I don't know much about that, because I've never had or been to a stag or a hen party.M: Yeah, but you must have seen some crazy stag parties British people, your people organize in, let's say, Budapest, for example, Amsterdam.R: I've heard what people in my country get up to, and I diss about everything they've done.M: Yeah. Yeah, dear listener, if you see a group of rowdy men doing all sorts of crazy things, perhaps they're British.R: It's not just the men, the women are just as bad.M: Oh, yeah, women are even more horrible. You can say that I love parties, I am a party animal. Or you can say that these days I'm less inclined to go to big events. So as I get older, you know, I'm 30 years old... So I find myself less inclined to go to parties. So I don't like parties as much as I used to. I don't like the noise or you can say I love the noise. I love a good party. Or you can say I prefer a small gathering of friends. So a party is a gathering. So you get together with your friends. You can call it a get-together. Also, like, don't think that a party should always be a big party. Could be anything. You have your three friends. So there are three of you, it's already a party. Or even with, like, two of you. Or maybe you are alone and it's a party.R: Maybe you're alone and you're just crazy.M: Yeah, you know? I have a party with my cat or with my dog, with my fish. I prefer small parties, or I prefer big parties. I prefer birthday parties or wedding parties. Or there are different kinds of parties, surprise parties, garden parties. Maybe you like cocktail parties. Tea parties. Ooh, tea parties are my favourite. Tea parties, dear listener. Maybe you enjoy your dances and costume parties. When everyone wears a mask or a costume, it's called a fancy dress party. So maybe you enjoy these ones. Then pool parties. Ooh, nice, I love a good pool party. So a party by the pool, or maybe graduation parties, dear listener. When you finish school or graduate from a university, you have a graduation party. Also, there are parties which are called showers. For example, a baby shower. Rory, what's a baby shower?R: That's just a celebration of when someone finds out they're having a baby?M: Yeah, for example, your friend is having a baby, so they are throwing a baby shower, so the woman and her future baby and everybody comes in with presents. Yay. These days, gender reveal party is a very common type of party where the gender of a future baby, no, a future baby, of the baby is revealed. So you kind of, you find out, is it a boy or a girl? Housewarming party, dear listener. You move house and you have a housewarming party. Farewell party. Oh, gosh, so many parties, yeah. Pre-party and after-party.",

I don't see why I should have to pay for apps that are riddled with adverts.Maria: What apps don't you use anymore?Rory: I think I stopped using a few financial ones after I closed my account.

Well, it would be easier to say what I don't use, to be honest. I use a whole load for social media and social networking, and then they're the ones that manage my calendar as well, so I don't forget things. Not only is it about my social life, though. My work's also on there. I use different apps to publish things from time to time, like on Instagram.

Apps that you use, download, pay for or use them for free. But an app is something that you download. Right, Rory? So, you download an app and you use it. On your phone, usually.Roru: Well, most of the time, yes. But you also have apps which are pre-installed or pre-downloaded onto your phone. Like a voice recording app, for example. Which can be very useful for recording yourself when you are preparing for part 2 of the exam. I'm just suggesting that.Maria: Yeah, true. You can say that I pay for certain apps. Or I spend my money on gaming apps, for example. Or I pay an annual subscription fee. For many apps, you have to subscribe.Rory: You have to subscribe to our podcast. It's not an app. But you have to subscribe to apps if you want to use them on a monthly basis.Maria: Yeah, and a good deal is to subscribe for a year. So, you pay an annual subscription fee. So, for a year. Annual means for a year. Or you pay every month. This means that I pay a monthly subscription fee. Or I pay every month. I pay every year for some banking apps, for example. There are like banking apps. You download an app for your bank. Really? You pay for your banking app?Rory: I pay something like 10 pence a month for some things. But it's not a lot, to be honest. I think it's just a...Rory: Wow, it's supposed to be for free. Banking. Wow, interesting. You can say that I pay for some fitness apps. Some education apps. Lifestyle apps. So, you can just not mention a name but say that I have entertainment apps. Like music applications. Spotify, for example. Or I pay for some business apps. Food and drinks applications. News applications. Game applications. Travel applications.Rory: Delivery applications.Maria: Yeah. Okay. So, social media applications. So, just naming them in general. I have some education applications, which I pay for.Rory: Well, you could name some specific ones. For example, Canva is a well-known, I suppose, digital editing app. And content creation app. Thank you, Canva, for sponsoring this podcast.Maria: Some apps are riddled with adverts.Rory: But that just means they're full of them.Maria: Yeah. And most apps are for free but there are adverts. Advertisements, ads, pop-up ads. So, riddled with, to be full of something. Could you use it in another sentence, Rory?Rory: Well, on-demand television. And television in general, I think, is riddled with ads. You see them all the time now. And sometimes you go to websites, and those are riddled with pop-up ads. Our website only has one pop-up ad for classes with me. Subscribe today.Maria: If I say that my essay is riddled with mistakes, what does it mean?Rory: It means it's full of mistakes. And that's a good point, actually. Because when something is riddled with something, it means it's almost always in a negative way. I've never heard it used to talk about something positive.Maria: Oh, I don't like these apps which are riddled with adverts. So, I pay for applications. And usually, if you pay for an app, you use it without any adverts, ads, advertisements. I stopped using something. So, stopped doing something. I stopped using a few financial applications. I closed my accounts. And I stopped using some gaming applications. Some game apps. Because they are a waste of time. A complete waste of time, dear listener. Yeah.Rory: In my opinion.",

Of course, I also listen to rock music, so someone jamming on a guitar can be quite fun as well when the occasion calls for it.Maria: Do schools in your country have music lessons?Rory: As far as I'm aware, yes.

Cow. Black and white. So, what do you call a cow that can play a musical instrument? A moosician!Rory: I have a... I have a better one. And I'm not... I'm not joking when I say this. My friends and I have a WhatsApp group, and they've just sent something which is a complete coincidence. And this joke is amazing. So, this is from the ex, or the Twitter feed of PETA, which is an animal rights organisation in the UK. And they've posted something that says, cows are friends, not food. And someone replied saying, name one cow you're friends with. And this organisation's Twitter account replied with, your mother.Maria: Wow.Rory: Oh, that's so good. I love it.Maria: Yeah, dear listener. So, they called someone’s mother a cow.Rory: Yes, which is a way of referring to an unpleasant woman. It's not a nice thing to say, but it's an amazing coincidence for this podcast. An actual coincidence! Now we can move on. Hooray!Maria: So, dear listener, you listen to music. Okay? I listen to songs. You don't say to, but I listen to songs. I listen to music. So, make sure that T is there.Rory: That's so important. I cannot stress that enough. The number of people who study with me right now who make this mistake. Please, please listen to music.Maria: And if you listen to different kinds of music or different genres, you can say that it's a rather mixed bag. So, a mixed bag of different genres, right? The different kinds of music, right, Rory?Rory: Yeah. I couldn't think of... Oh, now I can. I said it's a mixed bag, but what I should have said is I have a fairly eclectic taste in music. Oh, yes. That also means it's just mixed. Eclectic is definitely a C2 word.Maria: Yeah, so kind of like different kinds of music. You listen to pretty much everything. Classical music, jazz, pop music, blues, electronic music, funk, country music, dance music, rock music, pop music, electronic music, heavy metal, hip hop, folk music or country music, soul, Latin, disco. What else?Rory: So many!Maria: Yeah, okay.Rory: Some even have names that sound made up.Maria: I don't have a favourite genre, okay, or kind. I tend to latch onto specific songs. So, if you latch onto something... You listen to it until it becomes boring, which in my case is listening to the same song something like a hundred times. Yeah, so if you, I don't know, enjoy Queen, you know, Queen.Rory: I do know Queen, yes. Not The Queen. We've made that mistake before.Maria: No, no, no, no, Queen. So, if you enjoy Queen, you kind of stick to listening to Queen, their songs, or you latch onto something. Latch onto something is a phrasal verb. So, to become connected to something. We can also latch onto someone. If you stay close to someone, spend a lot, a lot, a lot of time with this person. So, kind of like he latched onto me. He started spending a lot of time with me, but that's negative, Rory?",

I think it was when I was abroad, actually. There were rows of stalls flogging all kinds of things from jewellery to stationery. It was very interesting to see, actually. We don't see so many stationery stalls at street markets in my country.Maria: Do you prefer shopping in a shopping mall or at the street market?Rory: Well, I like to get everything in one go, so shopping malls cater to this nicely, unless I'm shopping for something special like a souvenir.

      "Maria: Yay! So, dear listeners, street markets, so what's a street market? Usually, it's an open-air market, so a shop in the open, okay? So, you go to a market square, or to kind of like a big street or a square, and there's a market, open-air places, open-air markets. Usually they happen on the weekend, but not necessarily, and there are different markets. For example, a market where you can buy food, or a flea market. Rory, what's a flea market?Rory: Isn't that where you can buy second-hand things at reduced prices? Is that right? I've never been to a flea market, so I don't know.Maria: No? Oh, wow. So, there are famous flea markets all over Europe, and they're quite beautiful markets with music and food and dancing and different events every weekend. So, you can buy second-hand clothes, bags, antiques, some vintage stuff, furniture. A flea market, like F-L-E-A. Or you can talk about the farmers’ market, where you can buy food, local products. There are also some, I don't know, like garage sales. So, for example, if Rory wants to sell his stuff, Rory organises a garage sale of his personal stuff.Rory: Even though I don't have a garage. It's still called a garage sale. The reason why is that's usually where all of your old things are kept. If you are from a middle-class background, but I live in an apartment, so there is no need for a garage or a garage. I also don't drive, so there's like a compounding lack of need here.Maria: So, dear listener, in your country, there are flea markets. There are garage sales. There are farmers' markets. Even if you don't know of them, there are lots of street markets. But some of them are called, aren't they, like, fairs? A fair. What's a fair?Rory: A fair, that's less a market and more, I think, they're usually connected to some kind of celebration. So, for example, you might have a fair with different rides on for a particular holiday. And there might be stalls connected to that, but fairs and markets are generally separate things. One is about celebrating and having fun, and one is about buying things.Maria: Yeah. So, a fair is a large public event where goods are bought and sold, usually from tables that have been specifically arranged for the event. Yeah, actually, a craft fair. And you go there and you can buy some wooden stuff from the local people. So, a craft fair. You can talk about, like, craft fairs or vegetable fairs that are organised every weekend in your city or village, wherever you live.Rory: If indeed they are.Maria: People bring their wares to the city centres. Wares. Rory, what do you mean by wares?Rory: Wares are just the things that they sell or the things they make in order to be sold.Maria: Their products, their goods, their wares. When the examiner asks you, when was the last time you went to or when was the last time you saw? And then you kind of, you react naturally, dear listener. It's super Band-nine important. You just say, well, I don't know, really. That's a good question. Well, let me think… a street market. Probably it was when I was abroad, actually. OK, so a very natural response from Rory. And then you talk about... Then you talk about stalls. So when you are at the market, you see different stalls. And a stall is where products are laid out for you. A stall, like a vegetable stall, a large kind of table with products. And you can say that there were rows of stalls. So lines of stalls, many stalls. And people sold all kinds of things from jewellery to stationery. So all kinds of things. Rory, if I say that I can buy knick-knacks at a market, what do I mean?Rory: Is that not just… you buy odds and ends, which is another word for bits and pieces.",

    conversation:
      "Maria: Rory, is your home clean?Rory: Isn't everyone's? Yeah, I do some dusting and clean the dishes fairly regularly. Though for bigger cleaning jobs, I usually hire a cleaner to get the place in good condition before I have company around or something like that.Maria: Do you like housework?Rory: I like it when it's done. I'm not a great fan of the actual process of it. It eats into time I could be spending on something else, like reading or just relaxing.Maria: What housework do you dislike?Rory: I'm not a huge fan of cleaning the kitchen or the bathroom, really. The moment you're done, people are using those rooms and making them messy again. So it seems rather pointless. Of course, a home isn't always in a perfect state of homeostasis, so that's not true. But it definitely feels like a waste of time, at least from time to time.Maria: How often do you do housework?Rory: It depends on the job we're talking about, I suppose. If it's a whole house clean, then that happens every few months or so. But I do things like sweep the floors every week, and doing the dishes is a daily task.Maria: Will you do more housework in the future?Rory: Oh God, I hope not. I'm not a big fan of it now and I hardly do anything. Could you imagine what I'd be like if I had more to do? Ideally, I'll have a few robots or machines to take care of all but the most finicky tasks, which they can't do. And that will be it.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: So, dear listener, housework or what's the synonym for housework?Rory: Chores? Domestic chores.Maria: Chores, yes. Or household chores.Rory: Ooh, fancy.Maria: And, Rory, what verb do we usually use? Do we do, make, chores?Rory: We do the chores.Maria: Yeah, do household chores. Or housework, do housework. Okay? So do housework, do household chores. Is your home clean? You can say, yes, it's quite tidy.Rory: That's none of your business.Maria: So, like, the examiner looks at you like, you know, like, um, is your home clean?Rory: Oh, they look you up and down. They're like, is your home clean? I see how dirty you are. I wonder what your floors are like.Maria: So you can say, yes, it's quite tidy. Tidy, like clean. It's quite clean. It's quite tidy. Sometimes it's a bit messy. You can say messy. I have a messy flat. I do some dusting. And then you can say what chores you do. Do some dusting. Dust is this thingy that is everywhere in your house, two minutes after you've cleaned everything, you have dust already. And clean the dishes, for example. If I have bigger cleaning jobs, I usually hire a cleaner. So what do we call people who clean our flats?Rory: Cleaners. Domestic servants. I have a cleaner. I would not call Angela my domestic servant. That's crazy.Maria: Yeah, or you can say that I have my house cleaned, which means that you don't clean it. You hire some people. And like I pay to get my house cleaned. Then you can say that I do the laundry. When you wash your clothes, I do the laundry. I enjoy vacuum cleaning. Like hoovering. When you hoover. And all this, you know, all the dirt is sucked into the....Rory: That's the sound a hoover makes. Why is the hoover crossed or the cow? Have you just totally lost it?Maria: Yeah.Rory: Okay, now that we've established that.Maria: Maybe you do the gardening, and it could be considered as a household job. You clean the floors. You do the dishes. You can say I like housework. I hate housework. I can't stand housework. I absolutely hate it. I'm not a great fan of housework. Well, like I'm not a fan of it. That's a nice phrase. Please don't say I like if the examiner asks you. Do you like? Well, yes, I do. Or I'm not a great fan or I hate it. I can't stand it. I'm not into it. It's not my thing.Rory: Talking of not being a fan of things, how many permutations of fan did I use in my answers?Maria: Yeah…Rory: I use different ones. I said not a great fan, not a huge fan, not a big fan. I do not recommend doing this for your answers. It's just showing what can be done.Maria: Yeah, yeah. And to show you what phrases we can use with fan. It eats into time. Housework eats into time. It takes a lot of time. Yeah, and if you live in a large flat or a house, it takes so much time to clean up. Especially after a big party. And you can say that it eats into time I could be spending on studying, working, or relaxing. I'm not a huge fan of cleaning the kitchen. I'm not a huge fan of cleaning the bathroom. Like, what else do people do when they do housework?",

If it's an actual emergency, then people can always call me and I will definitely see that.Maria: Did you send more messages when you were younger?Rory: Absolutely! But there were fewer alternatives back then. We used to just send something like an SMS on our phones and that was it. It's different now with smartphones and near-constant internet connections. You can be messaging all the time.Maria: Is sending messages popular in your country?Rory: Via text? Maybe if you're an old person or someone without a smartphone, but that's a rarity in my experience. Most people just message on their smartphones using different apps, like WhatsApp, for example. Unless, again, we are counting using those to message as texting, but then if we are, that's pretty commonplace.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: Hey, right Dear Listener! So, text messages. Rory, first of all, what are text messages, and what's going on?Rory: I don't know what's happening with these questions, because my understanding of a text message is something that you send from your phone, like an SMS, which is not something that many people do in my country anymore. We have texting with the phone, and then we have messaging with apps like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. So, I see these as two distinct and different things, but it's possible that the examiner sees them as the same thing.Maria: So, if I say text messaging, this means that I write a message on Telegram or WhatsApp, right?Rory: Well, some people can see it this way. I don't. I see them as different things.Maria: But what do you say? If you sent me a message on Telegram, what do you say?Rory: Yeah, I messaged you on Telegram.Maria: Okay, or I sent you a message on Telegram, or I just wrote to you on Telegram. So you don't use any like, I texted you, I wrote a text.Rory: No, I rarely hear people talking about that. But is that just because I'm not talking about it with people? Or is it because there's a totally different thing that we use to talk about texting and sending messages now, because the technology is so different from what it used to be?Maria: Yeah, people. So, when we talk about Telegram, WhatsApp, Viber, WeChat, or any other chat channels that you are using, local chat channels, so we say that I messaged you, or I sent you a message, or I wrote to you on Telegram, on WhatsApp. But, for example, certain businesses, certain companies could text you, not using any chat channels, they just send you a text, texting, okay? They send you an SMS. And perhaps some companies still do it. So if you don't have any Internet, for example, they can send you a text, an SMS. But these days, everybody is messaging on Telegram, WeChat. So you can answer these questions, talking about messages on Telegram, on different chat channels, okay?Rory: That's why I used some hedging language here, and I said, unless you count using those apps as texting, in which case I'm doing it all the time. And it's good to use alternatives to if.Maria: You can say that most of my messaging is handled by apps, which means that I message different people using different apps, like Telegram, WhatsApp, WeChat, and you can say that I never send any SMSs. Oh, a very interesting question, do you reply to messages as soon as you receive them? So you got a message on Telegram, and then kind of like, how fast should you answer, Rory?Rory: Well, this is a personal choice. But I always think that I own my phone, and my phone does not own me. So I will answer when I'm good and ready. But some people think that you should answer immediately. And I can appreciate why they might think that, but I don't see any reason to. If it's an emergency or if it's seriously urgent, you do not text. You call someone and you make the urgency clear. What about you, Maria? Do you have a similar philosophy? Or are you a text demon?",

History was one of my favourite classes, and I absolutely excelled at it when we wrote essays on it, regardless of the historical topic. Except for the history of agriculture, I have absolutely no idea why we had to learn about that or at least learn about it in such an off-putting manner.

It also has this massive collection of artwork and cultural artefacts that were produced by Native people from across the world.

And when a book is about history, we call it a historical book?Rory: I think a historical book refers more to how old the book is, whereas a history book is on the subject of history. We can also call it a historical account.Maria: Yeah, so we just say books on history.

They're kind of a pain, to be honest. They constantly interrupt video content to tell people about things that are unconnected to whatever you're listening to, which can be quite a jarring experience. Even if it's not video, banner adverts on websites can be distracting when you're trying to focus on reading something that you came there for.Maria: Do you see many ads on trains or other transport?Rory: I do, yeah, but they aren't as in-your-face as the ones on the media or in any media or on the Internet. They're usually limited to things like posters and maybe billboards if you look outside, which is excellent because I detest them.Maria: Is there an advertisement that made an impression on you when you were a child?Rory: There used to be an advert for Asda, which is our version of Walmart, that involved people saying their catchphrase, “That's Asda price”, and slapping their pockets to make the coins jangle together.

Your essay could be about advertising, Speaking part 3 could be about advertisements and advertising, and Speaking part 1, and Speaking part 2 as well: Describe an advert you like or dislike, or an advert that made an impression on you. Interesting, huh?Maria: So, even in IELTS, advertising is everywhere.Rory: Yeah. And, first of all, the word itself. We say advertisements, meaning like any advertisements on TV, newspapers, and the internet. You can also say adverts or ads. And advertising. What does it mean, like, advertising? What kind of advertising do you like?Maria: Yeah, the steps that companies take to promote awareness of their products.Rory: Advertising is a more general term. Like advertisements is a specific word, for example, an advert, like a pop-up advert on the internet, like pop, and it just like pops up, you know, all of a sudden. So it's a pop-up ad. But advertising, like there are different kinds of advertising, like pop-up ads, pictures in the newspapers, right? Some TV commercials. And you can say that I don't really like any of them. So I don't like any advertisements.Of course, the question is about the ones you like, so you can say, if we have to choose one, then these ones. But it's like a last resort. I try to avoid advertising. I have an ad blocker.Maria: And if you Google different types of advertising, you can find print advertising, broadcasts, video, TV advertising, mobile advertising, social media advertising, direct mail advertising, like they send you an email with some adverts, or invitations. Product placement is also a kind of advertising. Rory, what's product placement?Rory: Is that not putting products in media like movies and TV series? And it's not explicit advertising to draw attention to the product. It's just the fact that an actor or an actress is using a particular product.Maria: Yeah, also we have audio advertising, you know…Rory: We did that at the start of this episode.Maria: Usually, an advert has a jingle. If it's an audio advert, there's something like...Rory: Could you imagine if we had a song about our courses?Maria: Oh, yeah, that would be lovely. But a jingle is not a song, right? A jingle is something like a very short, I don't know, like short sounds, right? Jingle.Rory: No, it could be a song that's used in an advert.Maria: Yeah, also, actually, billboards are a kind of advertising, right?Rory: They are, yeah. I often get confused between billboards and other kinds of things. Because you have billboards and you have hoarding.Maria: What?Rory: Yeah, you have billboards and you have hoarding. Apparently, though, the only difference between them is a billboard is used in the UK and hoarding is used in America.Maria: Okay. Yeah, also, dear listener, you can talk about digital advertising and media advertising, if you want to be super cool. Podcast advertising.Rory: Which we are rather notorious for.Maria: Yeah, and also like banners, like display banners. If you read an article online, and then there's a banner, right?

For one of them, it will be in the middle of the day on my break from work. And for the other, it's in bed before going to sleep. I find it helps me unwind more easily than just scrolling through my phone or scrolling through social media.Maria: Do you prefer reading books or watching movies?Rory: I think that depends largely on who I'm with. If it's a group of people, it's a more fun social experience to go to the cinema. But if I'm by myself or just my partner and I are having a quiet day in, then I'd rather chill out with my nose in the book, frankly speaking.Maria: Have you ever read a novel that has been adapted into a film?Rory: Not recently, though I did read Jurassic Park as a child. That's about genetically engineered dinosaurs being let loose in a theme park. It's much gorier and more violent than the movie, though. But I think it took me weeks to read, just because of all the vocabulary in it, and I was younger and didn't know so much back then.Maria: Are your reading habits now different from before?Rory: Definitely. For example, I used to read until I got bored or tired. But now I try to limit myself to a chapter a day, just to keep my exposure regular and let myself mull over the ideas more effectively.

    discussion:
      "Maria: So, dear listener, books. At the start of this episode, Rory said, I'm ploughing through at this book at the moment. To plough through is a very nice phrasal verb, which Rory means what?Rory: To work hard to complete something. Usually something big.Maria: Finish reading, eating, or dealing with something with difficulty. But it means something difficult that you are doing. For example, it's a book on science, or a difficult book with difficult ideas, or maybe philosophy, or in Japanese pr Chinese language that you don't really know. So you can say, I'm ploughing through this book at the moment. And Rory reads super-challenging books. Science, engineering, medicine.Rory: Hold on a minute, I don't read any books on engineering.Maria: Ah, no, not yet. Okay, farming, agriculture, no?Rory: Yes, I have read books about agriculture.Maria: Yeah, there you go.Rory: In fact, it's mentioned in the book I'm reading right now, which is much more interesting than the lessons we had at school.Maria: I've built up a collection of unread books. So built up, I've collected so many books that I haven't read. So unread books - books that you haven't read yet. So you can say, I don't buy new books because I have built up, I've built up a collection of unread books. Or it's quite wasteful to buy more books when I have a lot of unread ones. Ones, meaning books. And if something is wasteful, you just waste your money or your time. So kind of you use it in a careless way. And I have a stockpile of unread books. So a stockpile is just like a pile of books, like a lot of books.Rory: Well, it's a lot of anything.Maria: Yeah, for example, like a stockpile of food, goods, weapons. So I have a stockpile of what? Of chocolate, of cash. I have a stockpile of cash. You know, like in mafia movies, they enter a flat and then everything is in money. Money is everywhere, you know. Ooh, they have a stockpile of cash. And you can say that when I get through them, I'll buy more. Get through books means to read books. So we have one phrasal verb, which means to read something difficult, plough through. Or if you just read books, you get through a book. So I got through this book very quickly. It took me one day to read it. And then kind of a very interesting question, like, do you buy books? Do you read books? Like, no, I just buy books.Rory: Well, you could borrow books from a library, I suppose.Maria: Yeah, but some people buy books, but they never read them.Rory: They're for decoration.Maria: I try and get through about two books a month. Look at you, Rory. Wow, a super reader, Band 9! So get through, again, I try to read two books a month. So I usually get through two books a month. I read a chapter each day. Oh, you are reading two books at the same time, right?Rory: Yeah.Maria: Okay, so Rory reads two books at the same time, right? And he reads a chapter from each book every day. Wow, look at you.Rory: I try to, it's been difficult recently with everything that's been going on.",

      "Maria: What's your favourite machine in your home?Rory: Well, I suppose the biggest time-saver is the washing machine, actually. I use it once a week, but it saves me from having to do all that manual labour of hand washing clothes by myself. I can't imagine life without it, actually.Maria: Do you read the instructions before using a machine?Rory: Normally, the first time, yes. Usually, the process is fairly self-explanatory, but it's always good to check. After that, I find it easy enough to remember what I need to do.Maria: Is it important to read the instructions?Rory: Generally, yes.

A manual or a set of instructions can be handy if you have to do something out of the ordinary, like use new settings, for example.Maria: Do you think washing machines and sweeping machines are important?Rory: I think the washer is pretty much indispensable at this point, given the number of hours it lets you spend doing other things, but when it comes to sweeping machines, I don't actually know what those are. So I couldn't say. They're definitely not so important to me. I mean, I know my way around a brush and dustpan reasonably well.",

      "Maria: What a topic, dear listener. Machines. First of all, what are machines? What is a machine?Rory: Mechanical things that make life easier.Maria: A piece of equipment with several moving parts that uses power to do a particular type of work. For example, a vending machine. Like, we buy our drinks and chocolates from a vending machine. Or a washing machine is a machine. But here, in this context, we can talk about different gadgets, dear listener, appliances that we usually use at home. So, home devices, appliances, gadgets, and AI-powered machinery, dear listener, that you use at home. And our common devices are air conditioners, refrigerators, blenders, air purifiers, and smart TVs.Rory: Maria's just listing things that I don't have in my home.Maria: Yeah, well, because you're boring. Come on. Just like, come on, come on. Rory, you don't need any machines because you are a machine, okay? Our listener may not be a machine. That's why our listener might have an automated coffee maker or a dishwasher, all right? A vacuum cleaner. So, dear listener, you can talk about these machines. And your favourite machine in your home. You can be very interesting and just say something more interesting than Rory. So, Rory, you just said a washing machine, okay. And a washing machine is a real time saver. It saves your time. It washes clothes for you. And what do you call a machine that washes the dishes in the kitchen, Rory?Rory: A dishwasher.Maria: A dishwasher, yes. So, a dishwasher washes your dishes in the kitchen.Rory: Do you have a dishwasher?Maria: Yes, I do have a dishwasher.Rory: Oh my god, that's amazing. I don't have a dishwasher. I have a pair of hands.Maria: Or you can say that my favourite machine is my multi-room audio system. Or it is my smart lighting system. You know, lights, all different lights. Or, for example, my favourite machine is a do-it-all smart oven. Be interesting, dear listener, even if you don't have anything at home. Just say, yeah, I love my smart couch station. Just Google it. It's amazing how many machines we have. Oh, it's amazing, you know. It's a smart couch station. So, you have a couch, a sofa. And then there is this little kind of table, a kind of coffee table, but it has different functions. It has a cup holder. It has an iPad stand. It has a cooling fan. Fan, you know, like you are sitting on your sofa watching television, and then you have a fan from this smart couch station.Rory: That's crazy.Maria: Like a super smart coffee table. I know… We usually read instructions before using a machine or a device or any gadget. They are also called manuals. Okay, so manuals or guides or instructions that we use before using a washing machine, for example. And Rory tells us, well, the process is self-explanatory. So, you don't have to read instructions. You can understand everything yourself. And it's like self-explanatory. No need to read anything.Rory: That's probably a very male interpretation of how you should approach things like this. I imagine some more sensible people would probably be like, oh, no, it's not self-explanatory. You should always read the manual in detail before you attempt to do things.",

      "M: Roro, do you like amusement parks?R: If I'm honest, not really. I remember going to Disneyland as a preteen and absolutely loathing it. Partially because I was a bit of a bookworm. But more so I found it really artificial and claustrophobic with all the crowds and everything. So it's not really my thing at all.M: How often do you go to amusement parks?R: Well, these days almost never. In fact, I don't think I've been anywhere near one since, well, since the time I described you there. Um, I'd need to think about it in more depth probably.M: When was the last time you went there and what did you do?R: Well, now that I think about it after that experience in Disneyland, I wasn't overly keen to have another outing to an amusement park. But I think there was one since then, I think the last time I was even close to somewhere remotely like it was when I went to this place in Spain with a bunch of rollercoasters in the usual, I don't know, amusement park fair. I wasn't very taken with it then either. To be honest.M: What do you usually do at an amusement park?R: Moan about it and want to leave. If you mean what people do generally, though, they go on the rides and live vicariously through others, if you're an adult, watching your kids, or they try and dodge the crowds. It's a shame I find it's such a downer, actually, because there, there's more to fairgrounds than just rollercoasters and crowds. Like the VR simulators look good as do those sort of lighter rides. It's maybe just the overstimulation that does me in, to be honest.M: Are there many amusement parks where you live?R: Um, I think there are a few traveling fairs and circuses, but nothing sort of on the scale of Disneyland. And the closest thing might be the big wheel in the middle of Edinburgh. And I think that would be maybe stretching the definition of amusement park from where I stand.M: Do you think you'll go to an amusement park soon?",

I worked on a small island, which is like sort of nestled among the coral reefs in Fiji, although that's not saying much, because many of them are. And I also lived on the much bigger island of Timor, which is, it's divided between East Timor and Indonesia.M: Are there any islands in your country?R: Oh, God, there are hundreds of individual islands. And they're part of sort of larger island chains in the archipelagos. I'd say the most famous are the Outer Hebrides and the Shetland Islands, which are the most easterly and northerly, respectively.M: Do you want to live on an island?R: Well, given that I've already lived on a few, I think I've kind of had my fill of them. Though I suppose if there were no alternatives, I could do it again, without much complaint. I'm quite self-sufficient. So it would hardly be a disaster.M: What would you like to do if you were on an island?R: Oh, I quite fancy going sailing, since I've done just about everything else you could do near the coast of an island.

You can find just about anything there. From phones to spare parts for scooters and motorbikes. I can remember wandering around this sort of ramshackle stores in this sort of chaotic grid pattern looking for a fan and a kettle. I needed them for when I lived at the school nearby. And we found them eventually, but it took ages because nothing is well signposted there.M: Which do you prefer markets or shopping malls?R: Shopping malls without question. Especially now in the summer when the air conditioning comes in handy. That aside the layout, it's more logical, and it's easier to follow than the mess that usually characterizes even small markets. You really have to hunt around in them to find what you want, especially if you don't live there.

I like the utility but I resent the distractions they inflict.M: What apps do you usually use?R: Well, usually ones for messaging and social media. I'm sort of led by my friends and colleagues in this respect. And take my cues from them on what's the best thing to use. I think the ones I've picked for myself were banking apps, and I have a transport app for the metro and for finding my way around. And I have one language learning app that I use because I need to, well, for all of these, like for the banking app I need to organize my finances. And for the map, when I need to get from A to B. And for the language learning app, I need to learn Russian somehow. And of course, these decisions weren't entirely independent either, were they?M: How often do you use apps?R: In a nutshell, probably too often. But if we expand on that a little, then maybe every hour, I'm awake, since people are always trying to get hold of me on social media, or I'm queuing up videos to watch or listen to. So that's a very noisy experience, isn't it?M: Do you use your smartphone more now than in the past?R: Oh, absolutely. Much more now. Especially since I installed all of the social media apps, the increase in connectedness to the world has definitely resulted in greater use. Not that this is necessarily a good thing.M: Are smartphones annoying?R: Well, that's very context-specific, isn't it? They tend to come in handy when you need to find your way around. But if you're trying to teach and they're going off all the time, and distracting students, then it's really frustrating. Sometimes I wish we could just, I don't know, flip a kill switch in certain places and have silence, even just for a few minutes.M: What kind of smartphone will you use in the future?R: Probably the one I have now, it does the job quite well.

It helps me interact with other people get access to media and run my finances and then get out and about when I need to. People often want something that is faster processing speeds.

It's set into the wardrobe so it's quite handy when you're getting dressed actually.M: Do you think mirrors are a necessary decoration?R: Well, I've never really thought about it until now, but I suppose you're right. Many people have them in their entrance halls at home, in the bathroom and the bedroom. Some people have them on their desks. I suppose. It's a bit like curtains really when you think about it. You don't really focus on them much. But you would notice if they weren't there.M: Do you often buy mirrors? Stop drinking your coffee and answer the question.R: I have never bought one in my life actually. They always seem to come with the places that I've stayed in. I don't know where you would even buy one. Like a specific mirror shop, probably. Furniture store or something like that.M: Where do you put mirrors?R: Well, it's probably easier to say where you don't put them really. They should be at eye level and in rooms or places where inspecting your face is part of the routine there. So the bathroom and the bedroom are the most obvious so you can check when you go out, and the vestibules or the foyers so you can check yourself out before entering a place with other people. There are places that break with this convention like shoe shops for example, where they have mirrors at foot level so you can look at your, well, you can see how your new footwear looks.M: Rory, do you have a mirror in your bag?R: No, I don't. I have on my phone. I can look at the reflection of my phone if I need to.M: Do you think you should have a mirror in your bag or in your pocket?R: Well, for me personally no. But I suppose for other people if they feel like they need to check their face or their make-up regularly then they can.M: Would you give a mirror as a gift, Rory?R: Not as a sort of generic present. No. I guess if someone was really into mirrors then if there was a particularly ornate one, then that might be a good gift for them. But it seems, it's a strange gift to give, isn't it?M: Hmm.

The makeup that used felt like it was like, like wall paint being applied to my face. You could feel it like filling the pores. It wasn't very nice.M: What does wearing make-up mean to you?R: Well, I'm not quite sure what you mean. If we're talking about what it involves. Then we could talk about doing your eyelashes applying lipstick, wearing concealer. If you're talking about who or what it's for, I think it's mostly about enhancing female attributes, especially on the face, though that's probably very Western way of seeing it, I suppose.M: Do you give make-up as a gift?R: Oh, I think I have a very long time ago. But it's not something I usually buy since I'm not exactly au fait with cosmetics. I'm much better at books or jewelry.M: What do you think when you see a man wearing make-up?R: Well, I imagine it depends on the kind. A lot of actors wear make-up and it's quite important for how they work with a camera as I understand it. And then sometimes male actors and pantomimes wear overblown amounts of it for a comedic effect. And I think some drag performers wear women's make-up as part of their personas for similar reasons.M: What about a woman? If a woman wears make-up, what do you think?R: Well, I was talking about this with one of my friends the other day, actually, and like people tend to notice more if women don't wear make-up than if they do. Apparently women look really different without their make-up. And I've seen a lot of my female friends without make-up, and they do look like a lot different in some cases.M: Do you think too much make-up on a woman, is it okay?

I don't really understand what people get out of looking like that. Maybe they see themselves differently, but I don't think it's a good look. That's just my opinion, though.

And then I think eagles in America when I was much younger, my memory is a bit fuzzy.M: Do you like watching animals in the zoo?R: It's definitely safer than watching them in the wild for sure.

More often than not, you see them in captivity like zoos or aquariums. Some animals are even monitored from orbit, I think. If you're a real adventurer, then you can go to the jungles, rain forests, and other untouched places of the world to see them.M: Is it important to protect wild animals?R: Well, insofar as it's important to protect anything or anyone from unnecessary harm. They're useful from a biodiversity perspective as well. Some endangered species need more care than others. For some wild animals, it's probably enough just to have laws against harming well harming them. And those are applicable to most situations. Others, like rhinos, for example, need, like protection from poaching, like, well, they have anti-poaching groups there.M: Should children learn things about animals?R: Ah, absolutely. Animals are incredibly interesting and can teach us a lot about the natural world. They even aid in their own problem-solving.

I think we did a bit on the rainforests and the habitats of wild animals. And but we never wrote about or studied them in great detail.

I never quite got into it, even though they were obviously really big fans of the idea. There were ones for Halloween, fancy dress parties, and some birthdays.

So we just have to keep going further with what we have, which is sort of environmentalism in a nutshell, really, isn't it?M: What's the importance of environmental education?R: Well, we could frame it in terms of financial importance, people save more by being less wasteful. Or you could think about it in relation to general education, which is like learning new ways of doing things hopefully more effectively and efficiently. There's a lot to be said for it from these perspectives already, actually.M: Is there enough education about environmental protection at school?R: In the mean, yes, though, I imagine there are ways of integrating more of it in a sort of more holistic way, rather than treating it as a separate subject.M: Is it important to teach students how to protect the environment?R: Well, insofar as it can give them a practical way to apply what they learn, I would say so, yes,. I mean, for example, we could talk about ways to save money using environmentally friendly energy saving methods in a math class. That's useful and helpful in equal measure.M: Would you like to work in a company related to environmental protection?R: Um, well, not me specifically, since my expertise lies elsewhere, however, we could have more environmental themes or elements in teaching. That might be a good compromise.",

Those are usually quite entertaining, aren't they?M: Do you watch them from the beginning to the end?R: Oh, only if they're interesting, or if I can't reach the skip option in time.

However, some ads are quite brilliant and funny. Like the iron brew adverts, for example. They usually have a story or a joke, which has great music too match the visuals.M: What advertising do you have in your country?R: Oh, it's everywhere. We have billboards, and posters, and viral marketing, and YouTube ads inserted into videos and ads and the breaks on TV shows.

      "Maria: Do you like smiling?Rory: Does anyone not like smiling? Of course I do. And it's probably a good thing since people say I have a nice smile. I'm not entirely sold on that compliment, but I like to be happy and I like to express that fact at least.Maria: When do you usually smile?Rory: Probably when people do the right thing or when they say something that I find amusing. I should say it doesn't have to be something morally right, just like, something, like, whenever a student can produce a flawless error-free sentence or at least try as hard then that's a cause for a small celebration. So I'll smile. Similarly, when I say amusing, it doesn't have to be something hilarious or intentionally funny. But I think it's important and interesting to show people when you notice these things.Maria: What can make you smile?Rory: Well, other people smiling is good for that. Likewise, when somebody does a good job of something, like I said before. Or compliments, everybody loves compliments, don't they? And whenever I see food I like particularly pizza, though maybe that's more of a predatory smile in the case of pizza.Maria: Can you identify a fake smile?Rory: I think so. Apparently, people have this built in mechanism to detect fake smiles. It's not something conscious. It's like an unconscious thing. I think it's something to do with only moving your mouth and not your eyes when you smile. You'd probably have to check that, but I think that's what I remember from the thing that I was reading. It's also clear from the context, since like, if the situation is serious, then you're less likely to see a genuine smile, for example. And you could probably make an educated guess as well if someone is known to be duplicitous person, for example.Maria: When was the last time you saw a lot of people smiling?Rory: I think it was when I was speaking club thing last weekend. So I went to help out a friend of mine. And it was really difficult few hours with squawking and squabbling children, reluctant students, awkward moments. But by the end of the lesson, the students were happy. They had a lot of pronunciation practice and they got to speak to a foreigner. And of course, we had wine, which is always helpful for making people smile in these situations. So everyone was happy and smiling by the end. Even though it didn't start that way, it certainly finished that way.Maria: Do you often smile when people take photos of you?",
    discussion:
      "Rory: Probably almost always, unless I'm being ironic or unless I see someone out of the corner of my eye who's annoyed me. I think it's hard, though, because first of all, like, I have massive dimples. So whenever I smile, people stop to comment about them. Which leads me to the second problem, which is - while people are having these prolonged conversations, my face starts to hurt from holding a smile for ages while people pass these comments. And I'm just sort of like: \"Could we hurry up and take the picture, please? Because my face is beginning to hurt.\" So I do smile, but it's probably... What's the word... It's probably more of a curse than a blessing.",

      "Maria: Rory, can you describe the place where you live?Rory: Oh, I can very vividly, since I'm completely in love with this place. So it's a three-bedroom apartment and the rooms are very spacious. There's a really well-equipped kitchen, both: a bathroom and a shower room separately, and the hall, the main hall is massive. It's not just like at the door and then there's the bedrooms. There's like, a sort of, internal space as well. I actually think it's the biggest apartment I've ever lived in. I'm really pleased with it.Maria: What can you see from the windows where you live?Rory: Well, it's somewhat depressing. It's just other apartments. But on the other hand, at least the skyline looks nice when it's all lit up at night. There's a small cluster of shops at the base of the building if you look straight down, which is convenient, if you need something at very short notice. And we have a McDonald's which is less convenient for my waistline.Maria: What do you like about living there?Rory: Well, the apartment itself is so massive that I can finally have people around without feeling like I've got people packed into a can of sardines. And the metro station is close by, so I can go anywhere I need to at a moment's notice. It's just... It's the most convenient and probably luxurious apartment I've been in.Maria: What do you dislike?Rory: I think the one thing I probably dislike is that it's a little further from where I usually get the bus to work, so I have to wake up about half an hour earlier than normal - about half past five in the morning. But on the other hand, I find I get more done that way. And it's a bit further from the gym as well and the place where I usually do my weekly shop. So there's that. But the situation's hardly desperate. I mean, if I have serious problems, I'll just get a taxi. It's not a big deal.Maria: Would you change anything about your home?Rory: Well, obviously, I'd have it closer to the metro station or just to places that I usually frequent, but I think that's it... Oh, yeah, I'd probably change the décor too if I had the time and inclination. But as we both know, I'm not very good at interior design.Maria: Do you prefer living in a house or a flat?Rory: Well, for the moment I'm happy with the flat I'm living in, which is good because I live in a city and it's basically all apartments in Moscow. I don't think there are many houses. When I do have a family, though, I think I'll choose to live in a house by the sea. I think that would be much better for them and me.",

      "Maria: Which room does your family spend most time in?Rory: Well, I don't have my own family, but if we talk about in Scotland, then we're always in the kitchen. It's where we have our back door, which ironically is the main door for getting into the house. Our front door is called the front door because it faces the seafront and... Anyway, we receive all of our guests and packages there in the kitchen, and it's where all the food in the house is. So it makes sense to spend the most time there.",

Well, since people have to look more closely at the person wearing it to understand exactly what color it is. And then on their further analysis, that's where you can start a conversation with them, which is quite fun. So definitely that one.Maria: Do before light or dark colours?Rory: Definitely colours on the darker side of the spectrum, as evidenced by my wardrobe. Although, someone said recently that I stand out better in lighter colours, which is why I have this pastel purple t-shirt for special occasions. But I think darker colours suit me better since I have darker features, which is unusual for a Scottish person, but it is something that I can take advantage of.Maria: Are there any colours, you dislike?Rory: Um, not really. Maybe like really garish colours if I'm pushed on the question. Especially on clothes or cars or houses. Um, it's like people are trying too hard to show off and get attention. It's much better to be understated in my opinion, although that could just be because I'm more interested in people's ideas than their appearances.Maria: Did you use bright colours when you were a child?Rory: Well, I didn't. My parents did. They used to make me wear all kinds of loud and lurid colours, which probably explains my attraction to darker colours now! It's just me being reactionary as an adult.Maria: Are colours important to you?Rory: It's not something that sticks out at the forefront of my mind... At least not very often. I would miss them if they weren't there. People sort of take them for granted, I suppose. But it's not... Like if I if you ask me to list everything that's important in my life, color would not be in the top ten.Maria: What's the color of your home?Rory: Well, it's a bit of a mishmash right now, actually. The hallway is rather conservative in terms of, like, browns and beiges. And yet my room and the bathroom are much brighter! For the former it's like, lime green on the walls, and for the latter it's sea blue. I didn't make any of these decisions, of course, because I rent my apartment. But it's quite funny when I look at it now.Maria: What colour would you like to paint your bedroom?Rory: I think the walls would be dark with white on the ceiling. I used to live with someone who had this colour scheme in their bedroom and I remember it being very relaxing, so I quite like the idea.Maria: What colour do you think is good for rooms?Rory: Depends on the purpose! For rooms filled with activity like the kitchen or the living room, probably brighter colours to complement the décor, for example. If it's a quieter space, like a bedroom, then probably something much less vivid... maybe something darker.Maria: Is colour, very important to you when you are buying something?Rory: Well, if we talk about clothes, it's probably almost as important as the fit. Although, this doesn't really add time to the... Well to the time I spend shopping, because it's not exactly difficult to find clothes in dark colours, especially not in Russia. For everything else it's not particularly relevant as long as whatever it is I'm buying works. Though, I'm unlikely to buy something bright pink since it doesn't really much my personality and it's a bit girly, probably.Maria: What colours do people in your country like to wear?",
    discussion:
      "Rory: I don't think there're really limited in that way. My best guess would be - it's a seasonal thing. So people wear darker colours in the winter and lighter ones in the summer. But there's a whole load of colours to choose from if you don't fit the mould in that particular way.Maria: Are there any colours that have a special meaning in your country?Rory: I suppose blue and white are the national colours, and then whatever colours are in the family tartan or football team colours... Those things are quite important. I can't really think of anything else off the top of my head.",

      "Maria: Rory, tell me about your country.Scotland, freedom! No, actually. I'm not sure what to tell people when they ask me about my homeland. I'm sure they get pretty good idea about it from all the media around it, which is probably just as diverse and varied as the country itself right now, when I think about it. It's a small place relative to somewhere like Russia or America, but I think we make up for it by our character and cultural contributions to the world. Um, I suppose you could say it's quite a rugged place, a bit like people as well as. This has Probably enabled us to make all of these contributions in the first place.Maria: Where is your country located?It's in the north of the island of Great Britain, which itself is in Western Europe. And we're part of a union of countries which share the same island. I suppose it's one of the westernmost country in Western Europe, maybe apart from Iceland, of course.Maria: Which part of your country do most people live in?Well, most people live in cities and other population centres in what's called the central belt. So that's close to the border with England. Actually, it's north of the border with England, but it's located deeper into the country than the Highlands and Islands. And and all of the major cities are near the coasts, although I think that's a common trait in just about every country, to be honest... Every country with a coastline.Maria: What are the main industries in your country?Well, until recently, the hospitality industry was probably our mainstay, along with tourism. Everybody wants to see the Highlands and Islands and take pictures next to people wearing kilts. I think we have some significant exports in terms of food and beverages as well. Like everybody has heard of whiskey and haggis and Scottish fudge, for example. So those are the main ones. But you can see they're quite varied.Maria: What are some of the good things about living in your country?Well, for all the jokes that we tell about freedom, we have a lot of freedom and wealth. For all the people complain that we don't, I think our country is actually quite prosperous. It's not perfect and it's not prosperous and great all the time. But we do a pretty good job of striking a good balance between constraining and encouraging people. It could always be improved, but I think there are a few other places that do a better job than we do.Maria: What are some of the bad things about living in your country?Well, I suppose one of the downsides of people having so much opportunity is that they do things that aren't always beneficial for society. We have problems with people having terrible health conditions, for example... Mentally and physically. A lot of the times though these detrimental sides to things come about as a result of poor personal choices. So in the same way, they can be fixed by people making the right ones, which they've got the opportunity to make.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: Is your country popular with tourists?Well, I think so. Compared to a lot of other places in the global south, for example. Yeah, lots of for example, lots of American tourists... they come because they have Scottish roots, so they're interested in Scotland, for example? Um, I imagine London and England as a whole might be more popular, but Scotland gets its fair share of tourists.",

Or sorry, the new Cold War between Russia and the West. And I still haven't finished it because of the tremendous amount of work I have. I didn't borrow it from someone, though. I borrowed it from like a... I don't know, we have kind of an open library at work. You can just take things and put things there as you please.Maria: Have you ever borrowed money?Rory: Uh, yeah, but again, not for ages. I'm pretty self-sufficient, so it's never really posed a problem, at least in recent years. Probably the last person I borrowed money from was... Maybe my friends when we were at camp together, I needed to buy a drink or something, and it wasn't serious, that's for sure.Maria: Do you mind if someone asks to borrow something from you?Rory: Um, usually it's quite all right as long as I get it back and even then, I'm usually a really patient guy, so I don't mind waiting a little bit before whatever I loan someone makes its way back to me.Maria: How do you feel when people don't return things they borrowed from you?Rory: Well, I'm really lucky because I have some... Well, most of my friends, that borrow things or who have borrowed things, are really responsible people. So it's not a common problem. But when it does happen or when it has happened, initially it's not normally a problem because I can cope without those things. I can't think of anything I couldn't cope without. Actually, even one of my laptops has gone on an adventure with one of my friends for most of the year now. I'm not particularly bothered. It's more if people are careless with my things that I start to have problems with their behavior.Maria: Do you like to lend things to others?Rory: If I know it will help them, then yeah. It feels really rewarding to know what you're doing is of use to somebody, if you can help further their goals in life. And of course, if you're lending something, then you're going to get something back in return. So it's not so bad.Maria: Would you let someone borrow your mobile phone?Rory: Well, after I purge the internet history and all of the dating apps on it, yes. Seriously, though, I don't think I have a problem with someone using it in an emergency or something like that as long as it comes back to me, that's fine.Maria: Is there anything that can't be lent?Rory: Well, yes, actually, it's funny. Sometimes people ask to borrow paper or a cigarette, and I'm not sure why they use that verb, because it's not like you want those things back when people are through with them. So probably things that have some sort of intimate or intimate use, or finite number of times that you can use them. That would be very difficult to lend, something like that. You give things like that, you don't expect them back.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: Have you ever lent your smartphone to someone?Rory: Yeah, at the weekend when we were ordering food, actually. The reason why that is, is because I'm rubbish at taking orders. So I usually just throw money or my phone at the problem until it goes away. And so in this case, I just handed over my my bank cards and my phone and said, just order the food so I don't care what happens. And they did it. So that was fine. And I got my phone and my bank card back, so it was OK.",

I'm actually interested in what other people have to say about different things, so all I need to do is think up the questions and then enjoy the ride of the conversation.Maria: How often do you talk to people on different topics.Rory: Oh God. I think probably every day. So if you think about being an English teacher in general, you speak to people about different topics because they need to learn the vocabulary and grammar connected to it, but and also just in my personal life... Like, I was speaking to someone the other day about how they teach chemistry online for example and another person was talking to me about playing board games. So it's a side effect of both my job and being quite gregarious and curious about other people, I guess.Maria: Who do usually have discussions with?Rory: Oh, everybody! I like talking to strangers as much as I like talking to my friends, actually! However, usually people prefer to talk to their friends and definitely I prefer my friends. So usually it's them and we're forever having discussions about different things: how to live what's happening in our lives what the next move should be. There are rarely any, I don't know, revelatory conclusions, but I think it helps people along and it certainly sustains the friendship.Maria: Have your discussion topics changed since you were a child?Rory: Well in some ways yes but in other ways they remain rather static, I suppose. For example, I still talk about things that I like but the things I like have changed, so I never used to speak about future plans for having a family, for example... If we compare this to when I was a teenager then I suppose few teenagers do like to have these discussions... But now it's probably one of the things that I talk about the most.Maria: Do you often change your opinions?Rory: Well I try to be as open to new information as much as possible and sometimes I realize that I'm going on a bit of a mindless rant about nothing as opposed to expressing a real opinion. On the other hand, I can be quite conservative, so change is often rather difficult for me, even if it's just a change of opinion. I think there has been some growth in this area of opinion changing however begrudging.",

      "Maria: Do you prefer to talk or to listen?Rory: Well, it's easy for me to talk about myself for hours on end, but I understand that most people prefer not to hear someone natter away like that. So I'm trying to change my initial preference to that of listening more. I think people prefer being listened to rather than doing the listening if we speak generally, and the same is true of me but I'm trying to change that.",

The other thing is, maybe it's just because I'm usually the most... This is going to sound like I'm bamming off a little bit, but usually I'm the most influential or powerful person in the room and maybe people are just laughing to make me happy. So it's really difficult to tell sometimes.Maria: Do you like listening or telling jokes?Rory: Actually, both in equal measure. It's fun being the center of attention when you crack a good joke and you make everybody lose the plot around you. But I also like listening to what other people have to say. I never used to, but I'm actually getting better at it and is a lot less demanding than being the center of attention.Maria: Do your friends like to tell jokes?Rory: Well, I think they prefer funny anecdotes like I do, but they're one and the same as far as I'm concerned. But yes, they like to tell jokes. They like to make people laugh.Maria: How do you know what jokes are proper to say to your friends?Rory: Oh, I'm very lucky. I've got very tolerant friends with similarly dark senses of humor, like mines. Almost pitch black. So I can push the envelope a great deal before anyone thinks things are inappropriate or disrespectful.Maria: Do you like to watch comedies?Rory: Oh, I love them.

So, yeah, it's a really cool thing to watch them.Maria: Are there comedy shows in your country?Rory: Well, maybe not so much these days, owing to the crisis, but there used to be quite frequently, especially at the Fringe Festival. To be honest with you, I don't think I've ever seen a bad comedian actually. They're always very engaging and entertaining, and they're really good at cracking people up.",

      "Maria: What's your hometown like?Rory: Oh, I don't know... Imagine a dumpster that's on fire... No, not really. Actually, there have been a lot of changes for the better made there recently. For example, we've developed the waterfront and all of the historical sites there so they're more accessible. And the whole thing is much more presentable than it used to be. And despite the crisis, the music and club scene is still quite good, although it's less so than it was just because of everything that's happening. So I think if you go there, there's actually a lot to write home about.Maria: How long have you been living there?Rory: Oh, I've lived there. Well... I've lived there on and off for about twenty four, twenty five years before I moved to Russia. So quite a long time, actually. Probably about more than 70 percent of my life.Maria: Do you like your hometown?Rory: Most of the time, yes, actually. There are some cultural aspects I wish people wouldn't indulge in so much like, I don't know, there's this thing about... People think... It's like the superior virtue of being from a bad area or having a bad background or things like that. So sometimes people think they feel that they are superior to other people because they've come from a rough part of town. But that's just like a small part of what is otherwise quite a really good tapestry - a cultural tapestry of the area. Lots of, sort of, cultural events happen in my hometown, for example, and there's lots of things to do and see there. So in general, yeah, I feel really positive about it.Maria: What did you like about your hometown when you were a child?Rory: I loved the coast or living near the sea front or this idea of living near the water. Although, actually, I suppose it's more like living near the river site because we live at the mouth of the river, or I lived there. My family still lives there to this day. It's full of all these little nooks and crannies that you could get lost in and have adventures. For example, there are some gorse bushes near the burn, close to my home, and we used to play in there all the time. So I think that's my favorite thing. And then more broadly, the people there are very... Like most of the people are really cool. I really like the attitude and the atmosphere there.Maria: What's your hometown known for?Rory: Well, actually, historically, it was known for the three J's which were: jute, jam and journalism. I should explain for those of you that don't know, jute like it's a kind of textile that's used in sack making, which was extremely useful in the industrial revolution. And jam, of course, is the thing you put on your toast and journalism... Well, there are lots of newspapers and printing presses located in Dundee. Unfortunately, the jute industry collapsed and the jam industry is more spread out. The journalism is still going, though. There's lots of publications. Most of them have moved online, but they're still there. And moreover, it's also known for its historical sites. And we have a huge extinct volcano next to, well, next to the town, which is called \"The Law Hill\". And that forms, like, a core part of lots of the cultural touchstones of different parts of the city. I think it's in the logo, actually, for the city council as well. So we're known for lots of things. It's quite impressive for such a small town relative to all of the other cities in Scotland, which are much bigger.Maria: How has your town changed in the last 20 years?Rory: Oh, it's changed a lot, for sure. The city council has really put... They've invested a lot of money into revamping the image both: in the real world and in people's minds. I think we were the city of culture one year for the UK, and we have brand and city ambassadors floating about. So they do a lot to promote the image of the city. It's not all superficial, though, like there have been some really tangible changes. Like I say, we redeveloped the waterfront close to the city centre. There are a lot of new businesses starting up. They're struggling a little bit now in the crisis. But still, I think the culture is much more vibrant than it used to be. When I look at pictures from the 70s and 80s, it seems a bit... Almost dismal compared to now.Maria: What changes would you like to have in the future?Rory: Well, ideally, I think there should be an expansion of housing for homeless people and people with serious social problems. I think it's a bit of a blight on the town, to be honest. And these people really don't get enough help. You see lots of homeless people and people with problems. I don't think that's the fault of the people whose job it is to do this. I think they just don't get enough money. So if they could have a budget increase, that would be cool. Although, that's my personal social crusade. I think my parents would probably just prefer the bins were collected on time. They're much more realistic and they live there properly. I don't.Maria: Is there good public transportation in your hometown?Rory: Um, I think so. I've not been there in a while, but I think the buses come fairly regularly and the trains run mostly on time. The infrastructure isn't as well developed as Moscow, but there are far fewer people. So we need fewer services. But certainly I never have huge problems. I suppose there could be more buses, but it seems to work for the vast majority of people.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: Do you think you'll continue living there for a long time?Rory: Well, I don't live there now. And I don't think I'll live there again unless I'm seeing my parents, for example. Ironically, because I live in Moscow now, I actually want to live in a smaller, quieter town to the north of the city and escape the rat race for good. But it would be OK to visit from time to time. I have lots of friends there, and like I mentioned in my previous answers, there's a lot to like about the city. So it's not a complete loss.",

And that aside, I've met a few singers and comedians and a news presenter, actually. They were all very engaging. You could almost feel the charisma or the aura that they have or whatever it is. So I could see where people get a bit starstruck when they meet celebrities in real life. Maria: What pop stars do like, and do you like any foreign celebrities?Rory: I suppose I like a range of musicians from Adam Levine. Or is it Levine? I can't remember. He's the vocalist from Maroon 5. And then we've got people like Kylie Minogue, although I suppose that's probably because she doesn't get involved in the drama of life like other divas do. As for foreign media, I don't really listen to much foreign music, although I listen to some of Sophie Tucker's songs from time to time, and she's quite good. I'm pretty sure she's Brazilian or Portuguese. So maybe that counts as foreign media.Maria: Who's your favorite celebrity?Rory: Oh, God, I'll probably be cancelled if I say who my favorite celebrity is. But a close joint second is held by two women. One's called Lauren Southern and the other one is called Candace Owens. They're, sort of, journalists/commentators in North America. They have really engaging manner of speaking that I quite like.Maria: Who's your favorite movie star?Rory: Um, I think it's probably either Chris Pratt or Chris Hemsworth. All the Chrises, frankly. I think they've got a good sense of style. And apparently, they're really interesting but respectful outside of their jobs. For example, aside from playing Thor, Chris Hemsworth is an avid surfer, at least I understand that's what he does, which is quite a cool sport to engage in, I suppose.Maria: Are international movie stars famous in your country?Rory: Oh, absolutely. I think Western media is sort of dominated by figures like that, regardless of which country you live in. And I think the same is true for Russia, although there's some home-grown entertainment figures, I guess, here, and they seem equally popular.Maria: Do you read news about celebrities?Rory: Oh, God, no. I can't think of anything more boring. Not unless it pops up on my news feed or Instagram or Facebook or something like that. Otherwise, I try and avoid petty drama like that.",

I think it's quite cool in a way, because you can actually speak to them directly, unlike before, when they were, sort of, more abstract figures on the silver screen, for example. I think it makes people more real.",

It brings order to the chaos of life and it makes it easier to work out what you need to do rather than just flying by the seat of your pants, I suppose. I think making lists is one of my favorite things to do, for sure.Maria: How often do you make lists?Rory: Oh God, probably every day, I imagine. Well, if we think about a lesson plan for example as a list of activities in a logical sequence and then there are things to add for each existing list that I already have. And then there are the tick lists that support my existing routine. So yeah, there's lots of lists and it's definitely an everyday task for me.Maria: Do you make a shopping list when you go shopping?Rory: I used to but I don't need to now since I've got one fixed list and it barely changes and it's one of the few lists I actually keep on my phone, so in this way I don't actually have to do that much with it.Maria: Do you make to do lists at work?Rory: Well my work makes the \"To Do\" list for me, I suppose. I just put everything in the right order. So for example, I have a list of classes and things connected to preparing for the classes and then there are things that crop up throughout the day or the week that get added to it. I say it's about 80 percent effective since I don't always get everything done on the day, but I just carry it over to the next day until I get it done, really.Maria: Why don't some people like making lists?Rory: Well, I suppose they just don't see the merit in it. Or possibly they're naturally organized and so they just do this as a matter of course. And the third option is that they just thrive on chaos. You find that with people who are quite artistic and creative, for example, they are not very good at making lists but they are very good at other things, so maybe that's why they don't like it, because it cramps their style in a way.Maria: Do you prefer to make lists on paper or on your phone?Rory: Well, despite the fact that I have my shopping list on my phone, I definitely say that paper is better. Probably just because I grew up with it. So because I've done it so much and it's just... I think it's force of habit for me. I can see the merits of having things on my phone though. It's more portable than a diary and maybe I'll switch over to that next year. But for no paper is my go-to option for making a list.",

So when I add my list to my diary plan or I already, kind of go through in my head what I'm going to need to prepare for that week.",

So both actually.Maria: Why did you choose this kind of work and studies?Rory: Well if we talk about work for example, then I picked it because, first of all, I was interested in it and then I had stuck with it because I'm good at it. I always wanted to be a teacher. I like helping people achieve their goals. I chose mathematics to study... Well actually mathematics chose me because I didn't have a qualification in this so I study it now in order to make up for the deficit in what I know right now.Maria: Do you like these job and your studies?Rory: No I love my job. It's wonderful and I look forward to doing it more often in the future when all of my courses are over. As for the course itself, I suppose I like the idea of learning something new. But as for the subject in mathematics I'm not exactly in love with it. I think I'd much rather do more things with English.Maria: What's the most interesting part in your work?Rory: Well it's never boring. For example, like, every day I work with people for different purposes and I work with different age ranges and of course we work on a variety of subjects as well. I guess my only regret is not doing it sooner, to be honest with you.Maria: What's the most difficult parts in your work and studies?Rory: Well, if we talk about my job then I suppose the most frustrating aspect is that people are sometimes quite disorganized. I don't mean the students... They're allowed to be disorganized because they're all young people but sometimes the adults I have to work with can be quite disorganized, or they haven't had their expectations managed well so they get quite disappointed. It's not a disaster, it just makes things more difficult. If we talk about what I study, then I think the most difficult thing is the subject matter itself because mathematics is difficult for me. I understand for some people it's easy but for me it's really not I don't have a head for it, so that makes life a lot more complicated.Maria: What do you dislike about your work or studies?Rory: Well I dislike that I have to deal with so many disorganized people. Although, it's not that many it's maybe only a few. But it can still get a bit annoying. And if we talk about mathematics I don't like that it's such a struggle for me to get my head around different mathematical formula without a serious effort. For example, linear equations or adding positive or negative numbers isn't my thing right now. It just means I have to put more effort in. But it can be quite difficult and I don't like it when I put in this effort and I don't see the progress.Maria: What was your dream job when you were a child?Rory: Well like I said before, I wanted to be a teacher. I've always thought that's a great profession to have. And so far I've not been proven wrong by this at all. I think it's been great.Maria: Have you changed your mind since then?",
    discussion:
      "Rory: Only in terms of the subject, because... Well, I always wanted to be a teacher. Then I narrowed my focus to English language teaching. But it seems like I'm going to have to broaden my focus again because I want to be a primary school teacher. So you have to teach English mathematics. All of the other subjects related to this.Maria: What kind of work would you like to do in the future?Rory: Well anything connected to education I suppose. Unless it's anything to do with management or teacher training I'm never doing that ever again once I'm finished with this!",

      "Maria: Rory, do you recycle?I suppose I try to. Whether or not I'm successful, it's another matter entirely. I think I'm better at reusing things or making them last than recycling them.Maria: What kind of things do you recycle?Oh... Well, you can recycle just about everything these days, can't you? I suppose things that I recycle the most are things like bottles and bags. I think everything that hasn't contained food at some point can be recycled, to be honest with you. And even then, some containers you just wash out and it's fine.Maria: Did you learn about recycling when you were a child?At school? I think it's more common nowadays. We used to be told a few things about it in class, but I don't think it's as comprehensive as it is now. People learn about the process of recycling and where everything goes, how to do it yourself at home. So I think they probably get it more than I used to.Maria: Is it easy to recycle where you live?Um, well, actually, in my hometown in Dundee, I think it's mandatory, actually, to the extent that it's actually ruined the schedule for the bins getting taken out. And in Moscow, it's more of a voluntary process. You have recycling bins and you can choose whether or not to use them.Maria: Do people usually recycle in your hometown?Well, like I say, they have to I think it's like a local ordinance or a law or something like that. So, for example, you have to organize things into different bins. Like, every household has two or three different color coded bins, I suppose is the best way to describe them. And then you have to organize different things into the different bins. But I don't quite understand how that works or what prevents somebody from just throwing everything into the one bin. Like, are the people who pick up the bins going to refuse to take this or something like that? I'm not sure how it works, to be honest with you.Maria: Do you think recycling is important?Well, it's certainly not unimportant, but it isn't my highest priority. To be honest, I don't really think it's something that individual people should have to worry about. I think it's probably easier to send all the rubbish to a recycling center or something and have all the sorting and everything done there rather than getting people to do it themselves. Because if you give people their own individual bins for each kind of thing to recycling, so say you have a glass bin and a plastic bin and a food waste bin, then you've just created all of these plastic products. And surely that can't be so good. Would it not be easier just to pay people to organize it for you? I mean, that might be less, what's the word, production intensive, I guess, is the right one. So for me, it's important, but not for the right people, I think. Maybe that's an unrealistic idea. But that's my opinion.Maria: Have your attitudes towards recycling changed over the last couple of years?",
    discussion:
      "Well, yes, because I've got that more developed idea about how recycling should function. Although, generally speaking, I think I'm probably more environmentally friendly now than I used to be. Um, but I haven't. Or at least I don't think I've made any major changes to my lifestyle. Maybe I reuse things more than recycle them, but is that because it saves money or is that because I just want to recycle more? Probably, more the former than the latter.Maria: Will you keep recycling in the future?And I'll keep trying to. But it would be very helpful if the infrastructure for it was more developed in Moscow and certainly if it became more efficient back home, it would be much better, I think.",

      "Maria: Rory, do you like sport?Rory: Um, I suppose, not particularly when it comes to mainstream sports, I'll watch the odd football match in the passing and I keep up with some news back home, but I wouldn't say I was a huge sports fan or anything.Maria: Do you like extreme sports?Rory: Ok, well, that's the one that tickles my fancy. I love extreme sports. I've been bungee jumping and the second the coronavirus restrictions go, I'll be shooting and I want to go glider flying and skydiving and zorbing. I think they're great ideas.Maria: Do most people in your country like sport?Rory: I think so. I mean, Britain is kind of renowned as a football and rugby obsessed nation. So it certainly seems this way. Maria: What sports do people in your country play?Rory: Well, like I said, I think football and rugby are, sort of, the mainstay sports just going by the TV coverage. But a lot of people also play golf, including my aunt and uncle. And in fact, I think golf was invented in Scotland. And of course, I think... Well, diving gets a lot of attention because there's like famous divers like Tom Daley they're... Well, quite well known, I guess.Maria: What was your favorite sport when you were a child?Rory: Oh, I loved swimming. That was the one I liked the most. I used to go every week before breaking for the weekend. That was great fun. I'm not so sure it was great fun for my parents used to transport me there, but I enjoyed it.Maria: Did you do much sport when you were younger?Rory: Well, aside from swimming, not really. I was actually more of a bookworm, to be honest with you, and I probably still am. I do more now, I guess... If you consider going to the gym and playing video games as sports, which some people do.Maria: What are the benefits of doing sport?Rory: Well, I think the health benefits are certainly the most obvious. So, for example, if you go and run around for a period... I think you're meant to have 30 minutes of intense exercise, so doing contact sports like football or rugby would count as that. So they're the most obvious. But there are social benefits to it as well, because you meet new people at football clubs, for example, or if you do martial arts, then you could meet people at your local jujitsu club. What's it called? A dojo? That's what it is. And, you can network there. If you're not there to make friends, then you could network. And if you have a business that you're particularly fond of and want to meet new people like that, for example.Maria: Do you like to watch sports on TV?Rory: Well, like I said, I'll have a glance in the passing, but I wouldn't spend a great deal of time on it. I don't have... Sorry, I have a lot on my plate right now, so there's not really a great deal of time to just sit and stare at the screen all the time. Maybe when I'm older I'll probably do it more often. You tend to see that in places where people hang out. Back home, there's lots of older men who go to the pub and watch football, for example. So maybe that's the destiny I have to look forward to.Maria: What kinds of sports would you like to try in the future?Rory: Well, like I said, all of the extreme sports! I'm particularly looking forward to going skydiving and flying a glider, I think that will be really good fun. But there's not really anything normal. I think the closest thing is probably taking up jujitsu again, I think I'd really like to start that over.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: Who's your favorite sports star?Rory: I don't actually have one, to be honest, I can think of some famous ones, but outside of their contributions to sport, I don't think they're particularly any more or less interesting than the people I know. So the short answer is - \"I can't say.\". And the long answer is - \"I can't say because I find people closer to me to be more interesting and famous people.\"",

      "Maria: Rory, do you like changes?Rory: I suppose it depends on what kind, actually. If it's a positive change, like, if your work at the gym is working well, then it's great. If it's a change for the worse, then it's not great, like, a change in working conditions to be at home, or, for example, which some of us are having to do now. I don't like that. I'd rather be in the classroom.Maria: Do you often change?Rory: Um, not too often. I have a pretty regular routine going on that I quite like, so I don't think I'd change it that much. Although, I should say it's designed to enable positive change through self improvement. So you could argue that I'm changing all the time, I suppose.Maria: What do you change?Rory: Um, well, I don't usually change it, but my workout routine at the gym gets changed by my personal trainer and I have the chance to change my lesson plans to suit the classes I teach, which is good for them and good for me. It keeps me on my toes.Maria: What would you not like to change?Rory: I don't like last minute changes, I suppose that's because I have a fixed idea of how things should be and then my expectations are set. But if we speak about more specific things, then I don't usually like changing my outfits, to be honest. Especially at work. I get quite comfortable with them.Maria: Have you changed a lot since your childhood?Rory: Oh, definitely. I used to be fat and eat junk food and I didn't study properly at all. So all of those things have changed for the better now, I think.Maria: What was the last change you made?Rory: Well, I say I changed it, but really my personal trainer changed it. I changed my routine at the gym. And by that I mean I hired a personal trainer to help make it more effective. So instead of just doing the same three sets of exercises all the time, now we do lots of different exercises and that seems to be working quite well.Maria: What has been the greatest change in your life so far?Rory: Probably moving to Russia, to be honest with you, I think it changed everything. I gained access to more opportunities for professional development, and I gained new clients, and I got to do a variety of jobs which expanded my competency. So that's been great. It was very worthwhile to move out of my comfort zone and move here.Maria: Have there been any changes in your hometown recently?Rory: I suppose it depends on how you define \"recently\". I think there are a lot of ongoing changes down at the waterfront area. For example, they're reworking and renovating a lot of the buildings there. And that's been going on for quite a while now. I can't think of anything that's happened this year just because of the crisis. But last year, I'm sure they opened a lot of new stores, for example. Whether that's still the case now, I'm not so sure.Maria: What do you plan to change next year?",

      "Rory: Well, actually, it's funny. We talked about changes to my career path because I'm going to change my career again next year. I'll go back to university and become qualified as a primary school teacher. And I'm planning to go all in on this podcast so we can open up a range of services online, amongst other things as well, and I'll move back home.

If we talk about computer chairs, then probably, like, a furniture store or an electronic store, perhaps, if it's got stuff for computers. But yes, I don't know much about buying furniture, so \"I don't know\" is the short answer.Maria: What did you last by?Rory: Well, I don't think I've ever bought furniture, but when I have to, I'll need to have the basics like a three piece suite and a bed...

      "Maria: Do you enjoy giving gifts?Rory: I like making people happy, but I'm not sure those two things are synonymous. Sometimes you can just do a nice thing for someone or pay a compliment, and that's enough. It doesn't have to be a physical thing, although I suppose a compliment or an action could also be a kind of gift.Maria: Do you prefer to give or receive gifts?Rory: Um, doesn't everyone prefer getting gifts? My philosophical approach to this kind of thing aside, it's nice to be given gifts, not just because it's nice to have things. Usually some things are useless, for example, but it shows the person is thinking of you and cares about you, which is really cool, I think.Maria: How often do you buy gifts for other people?Rory: Um, probably not as often as I should. Like, usually, every birthday for the people close to me, which is fairly regularly if we think about my family, for example. But I probably should buy gifts more often for them.Maria: Do you enjoy looking for gifts for people.Rory: If I know that they'll love it, then, yes. I remember one time I bought my friend a book I overheard him talking about. He lost his original copy, so I paid for a replacement. And then he did the same for me a year later. And that was quite cool. But normally I usually just ask people directly, what would you like?Maria: What do you usually give other people as gifts?Rory: It's usually something useful. So if we talk about my family, for example, my dad gets stuff for gardening. Actually, I just bought a pair of secateurs... And my brother gets protein powder or the like. And I think the only thing outside of that is - my mom gets her favorite perfume, which isn't useful, but it is nice and it does make her happy. So in that sense, it's quite useful.Maria: Do you give expensive gifts?Rory: Well, I always think the Coco Chanel perfume that my mom gets is quite expensive. Apart from that, I don't think so. I think I paid for plane tickets for someone once. That was quite expensive. But this is not something that I do very often.Maria: Do you take a gift when you visit someone in their home.Rory: Usually I'll bring a bottle of wine, although recently a box of Pringles is becoming my bog standard party gift to bring. I should probably shell out more actually for gifts to bring to parties.Maria: What kind of gifts do you like to receive?Rory: Oh, books, all the literature in the world would be a great start if anyone is thinking about getting me a present, just because I love reading. Other than that, clothes are always appreciated. I think... In my opinion, you can never have enough long sleeved shirts and skinny jeans.Maria: What gifts did you get when you were a child?Rory: Well, I used to get more books and fewer clothes for sure, although that equation seems to have reversed over time. And obviously when I was younger, I'd get, like, random toys. I had a lot of figurines of plastic dinosaurs and warships, for example.Maria: When did you last receive a gift?Rory: I honestly can't remember. I think it must have been my birthday and there was a plethora of things, although frankly, I think the best gift was having all of my friends around me. I've not seen my family in months, so it was nice to have that kind of emotional support there. So like I say, a gift doesn't have to be physical. It can be something... What's the word? Metaphysical.Maria: What kinds of gifts are popular in your country?Rory: Well, alcohol seems to be the done thing these days. Although, I suppose with the rise of things like Amazon, people have a lot of gifts that are tailor made for them now. But most of the gifts that I see people giving are alcohol based.Maria: What's the best present you have ever received?Rory: I think... Oh, someone special, once surprised me when I got off my plane! I wasn't expecting them to meet me. That was really nice. Sorry... Again, for me, like, physical things don't mean nearly as much as things like that. I think that's quite special.Maria: Have you ever received a gift which you didn't like?Rory: Um, well, OK, I'll preface this by saying I really hope this isn't taken the wrong way because I do appreciate it, but I got a really nice bottle of whiskey from my new workplace on my birthday a month ago. But the problem with it was that I don't actually drink whiskey. I prefer to drink bourbon. So that wasn't something that I particularly liked. But I should say that I really appreciated it because it was extremely nice and expensive and they bought it for me and they were thinking of me. So I did like it. And maybe one day I'll work up the courage to drink it.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: Rory, why do people buy gifts?Rory: It's like a... I suppose, a visual and physical representation of how much they value the person. It's like a nice way of saying I care about you have a thing to help you do things. That's a that's a major oversimplification, but that is what it means I think.",

So I use WhatsApp for general chatting, and Telegram helps me keep track of things related to the podcast. All of our stuff is on there.

They know that I was after them. So they'll get back to me when they can or if they can.Maria: Do you prefer sending or receiving messages.Rory: I suppose that depends on content of the message.

It shows the other person is thinking about you and it's nice to be wanted usually.Maria: Do you always reply to a text message?Rory: Uh, most of the time, especially with somebody that I know. I get some texts from random people and maybe spam from companies... So they don't usually warrant a reply, really... I think that's fair.Maria: In what situations is making a call better than writing a text?Rory: Um, if it's urgent or an emergency, I think those are the leading factors in that process. Um, more casually, I prefer to speak to my parents over the phone. It's like the olden days and you feel closer to people like that. But generally it's usually better to write a text than to make a call because it's faster.Maria: Is texting better than calling people?Rory: Um, I would say probably almost always. Because all the information is there and you can see it, and you can also multitask at the same time as you're looking at a text message, for example. So it's quite efficient and effective this way. Also there's no rush to make a decision! Like, in a phone call. Someone is there live waiting for you to respond. And that can be very pressuring and sometimes you can make the wrong decision. So I would say that it's usually better to text than to call.Maria: Have you ever received a confusing text message?",
    discussion:
      "Rory: Um, not recently. I think the closest thing I've had to something like that is when I get messages from random people with the wrong number. But even then, that's not confusing because it's obviously easy to understand what the purpose is and what the problem is. It's just not relevant to me. No, I can't think of anything... Sorry.Maria: Do you receive texts with ads?Rory: Oh, yes. Most often from my phone service provider, but that's not very often. It's more likely people will call you up with a scam or something, but even then, that's not happened for a wee while. So it's not so bad.",

      "Maria: Rory, what do you usually do on the weekend?Rory: Normally it's just a case of sleeping and recovering from all the work and working out during the week. So I get to have a lie in on Saturday and then I can... Oh, I can study and I can have brunch as opposed to breakfast. So those are the big things. And then usually I get to see my friends in the evening.Maria: Do you like to work on the weekends?Rory: Well, I used to, but now I study and see my friends. It's a lot less frenetic and more relaxing than before.Maria: Do you feel that weekends now are more important to you than when you were a child?Rory: Probably. I think now I realize how limited the time is. And when you're younger you kind of take the weekend for granted, don't you? So, yes definitely. And I think most people realize that when they're older as well.Maria: What would your ideal weekend be like?Rory: Well, I feel like they're already ideal, to be honest. Because I spend all morning in bed, basically. And then I'll wake up and work out and I'll have brunch or lunch, and then I go shopping. And then I can study and I get to see my friends in the evening like I said. So it works out fairly well for me.Maria: Is it important to make the most out of your weekend?Rory: Oh yeah. 100 percent. I actually feel quite strongly about this. I don't like wasting time on frivolous nonsense at weekends. And it's important to make the best use of the time that you have. I don't think anybody goes to their deathbed wishing they'd spent more time at work like: Oh I wish I'd spent more time in the office rather than hanging out with my friends or doing something fun with my family at the weekend.Maria: Which is your favorite part of the weekend?Rory: I think probably early afternoon on Saturday. I guess that's when I look and feel my best probably after I sleep and finish the gym.Maria: Do you think your weekends are long enough?Rory: Well, basically yes. Although, I think everybody wants more time, don't they? The odd long weekend probably wouldn't go amiss but the two and a half days that I usually get is quite fine and I can go back to work. So it's not such a big deal.Maria: How important do you think it is to have free time on the weekends?Rory: Well, it's essential for the reasons that I mentioned, isn't it? I think that you're supposed to use this time to relax, aren't you? So it's it's really important, isn't it?Maria: In your country do men and women usually do the same kind of things on the weekend?Rory: Probably yes. Before the whole hoo-ha with the pandemic most people went out and spent time with their friends and family. I don't think there's a big difference between what men and women did... Maybe in terms of activities, like, women would be more likely to get a manicure or something. But I think most people just want to have a nice time at the weekend.Maria: Why do you think many people consider the weekend to be important?",
    discussion:
      "Rory: Well it's important to have this, kind of, intermission between workweeks, otherwise they all blur into one and that can really stress you out. I think it's also an important escape from the daily grind, more broadly speaking.Maria: What are you going to do next weekend?Rory: Well it's a good question! If I feel better then I'll go out with my friends. But if not then I suppose I'll better stay home and study.",

I usually have everything planned out quite clearly in my head, and I have everything prepared and ready to go. So I can afford to take life at a slower pace! Maybe once or twice a year I'll be in like a real, sort of, scramble to get things organized. But it's not often.Maria: Do you like doing things quickly?Rory: Well, if at all possible, yes. Although, some things require a more thorough approach like, oh, doing the dishes, for example, you know. You want to do that quickly, but if you do it too quickly, then you might make a mistake and then your dishes are disgusting. So some things are more important to do more slowly than others. But generally, I like to be quick.Maria: What do you often do in a hurry?Rory: I think... things that are boring or things that are overly easy, like filing reports, for example. I just breeze through it just to get it out of the road. And if anyone has any questions about anything in the reports, then they can ask questions and I'll clarify there and then after the fact.Maria: When was the last time you did something in a hurry?Rory: I think a few days ago I was in a bit of a rush to get ready for work, actually, because I'd stayed in bed too long and I kind of lost track of the time. So I didn't have long to get the bus. And actually, if I'd missed the bus, then it would have been a very expensive taxi ride to work.Maria: Do you like to finish things quickly?Rory: If I have better things to be getting on with, then yes! I suppose, like... Well, if we go back to the idea of filing reports, for example, you know, it's not super important to file reports, but it has to be done. And then once that's done, then there's always something more important to be done, like getting ready for the podcast, for example!Maria: What kind of things do you never do in a hurry?Rory: Anything where I'm paid to give high quality work or produce high quality work, I should say. So anything like teaching, for example, or giving feedback, I mean, people pay a lot of money for this. So it's important that I spend a bit of time on it.Maria: Is it good to be always in a hurry?Rory: No, not at all! People need to chill out and remember that life isn't a race and they should stress a lot less. It's not worth it.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: Why do people make mistakes when they're in a hurry?Rory: Well, probably because they're not paying attention and they paint very broad strokes with whatever is their doing. So they get 90 percent of what they want done just fine. But then they've ignored 10 percent of it and sometimes that 10 percent can be quite important. So that's not good.",

It seems like an entertaining prospect when you consider like how much of a city boy I am. I did go fishing once, though, with my dad. And I think I really wanted to go and I complained about it for a while. I was, like, begging him to go. And I think I might have romanticized it a little because it was awful! I didn't catch anything. And the weather was terrible. So, yeah, it just wasn't a good idea. The one time that I did it, wasn't a good idea.Maria: Where do people go fishing in your country?Rory: Oh, I suppose you could go anywhere. We're surrounded by sea and water in general in all directions. So you could go fishing by the shore. For example, we also have some lakes so you could fish by the lake side and I guess in the rivers as well. We've got lots of those. So there's lots and lots of places. I think maybe there are even fish in some of the reservoirs.Maria: Is fishing a good hobby? Rory: I think maybe if you have the patience of a saint. God knows, when I was younger, I didn't. But if you're patient enough and you have the skills, then it's a good hobby.Maria: How often do you eat fish?Rory: Oh, all the time.

So for me, it's just easier to just buy it as if it's being prepared by a professional.Maria: Do you keep fish as pets?Rory: No, I can't afford an aquarium right now, but I think it would be nice to have a few goldfish in the future.

So I have a lot of experiences like flying a glider, going shooting and goings zorbing lined up for when I go back home.Maria: Is it good for people to try new things.Rory: Well if they've got a high level of openness then yes. But some people are quite set in their ways and they don't like taking risks, and that's OK too most of the time. Personally I think getting out of your comfort zone helps build character and creativity. But that's just me...Maria: Why are some people afraid of trying new things?Rory: Well, like I said, some people are naturally conservative so they can react that way. And it's usually scary the first time you try something. Like, for example, when I first started going to the gym it was kind of scary doing everything for the first time in front of people. So that can be a bit daunting and can be kind of off putting, I suppose. But you get used to it and you get over it.Maria: What help do people need when they're trying new things.Rory: I suppose they probably need confidence and curiosity. And if it's a skill, then they'll need a good memory or a pen and paper to take notes... Oh, and probably a patient teacher or instructor. I think it makes a difference as well to have realistic expectations. Experts and videos can help with that because they can show you what you should expect from the experience.Maria: What are some of the difficulties a person might have when they try something new.Rory: Well I suppose persevering with it and maintaining confidence. We've just talked about how they might be scared as well actually, haven't we?Maria: Do you think it's better to have new experiences when you're young or when you're older?Rory: I don't think age is a very serious factor to be honest... I suppose either way and it doesn't really matter, unless it's something super demanding, like, if you're 80 years old you're probably not going to go mountain climbing. But most people aren't going to go mountaineering anyway... I guess when you're young everything is new as well, isn't it? Whereas when you're older you appreciate it more. So I don't think age matters but I think it will influence how you see whatever it is you're doing.Maria: Did you try new activities when you were younger?Rory: Not really. Actually it took me a very long time to come out of my shell. I'm much more open to new experiences now.Maria: Do you like to try new activities alone or with friends?",

      "Rory: That's a very good question actually! I suppose it depends on the kind of activity, because you have traditionally group activities like having a barbecue or going camping... this kind of thing, then you'd probably want to do that with your pals. But if it's something, like, maybe, working out at the gym then maybe it's a good idea to do it alone so you're not distracted. Unless you were with somebody who has some experience. Maybe your friends have some experience there and then they could help you. So it depends on a lot of things actually. I think on balance I'd probably prefer to do most things with friends or at least with somebody, because then you have someone to help you.",

I think it's hard for everybody, to be honest. Some people think they can, but I don't think anyone can really. There's always one task that suffers.Maria: What may distract you when you are trying to stay focused?Rory: People talking. All the time. It's the main distraction. And sometimes I'll have a stray thought that I kind of run away with... but it is usually people talking. Whether they're talking to me or talking next to me, it's extremely distracting and I can't get away from it. So it's a real problem sometimes when I... Especially when I need to focus on something.Maria:: In what situations do you need to concentrate?Rory: It's usually when I'm making assessments, whether it's making assessments of people's language levels or lessons or assessments of how situations are going to go. Um, it's also important that I concentrate when something is boring. Like, if I'm in a meeting and it's boring, but it's essential, like if people are complaining and going on and on, but you have to listen to people at those times, even though they're being a bit boring.Maria: When do you need to be focused?Rory: I suppose when I study. Especially if I have maths, because I actually really need to build up my ability to focus there, because I often lose track of whatever is the calculations that I'm supposed to be making. And I also have to focus at the gym as well. You've got to pay attention or you could end up hurting yourself or other people around you if you're not careful.Maria: What do you do to improve your concentration?Rory: I remove distractions. Usually physically remove them. So for example, if I'm at my work, I'll only have my work on my desk. The phone will be away in my bag or I'll wear my earbuds to cancel out any noise that could be distracting... And it makes people think that I'm busy listening to something, even though I'm actually not listening to anything. I just don't want to be disturbed.Maria: What do you do to help you concentrate?Rory: In addition to what I just mentioned, I always like to have a set of goals or targets for the day to aim at, and I know that I'll feel really bad if I don't hit them. So that really helps me concentrate on whatever the matter at hand is.Maria: Is it easy for you to do two things simultaneously?Rory: I like to think I can, but the reality is the... Well, like I said at the beginning, one task, when you're multitasking, is probably not being done well. \"So no, it isn't\" is the short answer.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: Is difficult for you to stay focused on something?Rory: I think that depends on what the environment's like at the time.

So that helps me stay focused... No problem at all. But if it's loud and there's a lot going on, then it can be quite difficult.",

I think it's probably a bit much to ask my family to do something like that these days. And it's more original than going to the pub, and it's less stressful these days with social distancing and everything going on, so you can be outdoors and there's not so much pressure.Maria: Why do people go on picnics?Rory: Well, sort of like I said, when I think about it critically, I have no idea. There are bugs everywhere. People can have allergies to things. To be honest, I think it's more the novelty or the romance of it that sometimes people want to be around nature. Although, sometimes you can have too much nature.Maria: What do people do while they are on the picnic?Rory: Well, I guess they pack a few sandwiches and drinks and a blanket and go somewhere and then throw the blanket on the ground and enjoy the food they've prepared.

Um, and without them, civil society couldn't really function. More broadly, they're a big part of opinion formation on the issues of the day.Maria: Is news important to you?Rory: Well, yeah, you've got to know what's going on and it's important to be well informed.

      "Maria: Rory, where are you living now?Rory: I live in a... Well, now I live in a three bedroom apartment with a pair of colleagues. It's great! It's kind of central, actually, or at least I think so.Maria: What's your address and the flat number?Rory: I'm not telling you that.Maria: What's your passport number?Rory: No!Maria: OK, right. Confidential. Off record. Do you like the area where you live in?Rory: Well, I like it, but my friend said it's like the boondocks. I wish there were more shops nearby, I guess. But that's what the subway is for, so it's not so bad.Maria: What do you like most about your area?Rory: It's... Well, it's mostly quiet and there's a lot of greenery around. And I have a balcony this time so I can actually, like, stand outside and see the trees, which is good. And the transport links are quite well developed as well. So I can get around a bit more easily than before.Maria: What do you dislike about your area?Rory: It's mostly quiet, I suppose. There's a children's play park outside which can get pretty loud. And despite the fact I have a balcony, it probably needs to be renovated. So there are some small dislikes, but nothing major, to be honest with you.Maria: What have been some changes in your area?Rory: Um, well, I'm not sure about this exact place because I just moved here. But if we talk about the area in general, people say that the immigrant population is growing. But I guess you could say that about a lot of Moscow... and some of the roads seem to have been resurfaced as well. But those are the only big changes that I noticed. Everything seems to remain the same.Maria: hat can be improved in your area?Rory: We could get rid of the play park outside of my apartment. That would be nice. But actually, I'd like to see a greater range of shops nearby. Even though I can get there by the Metro, it would just be nicer to be able to walk outside and go to a shop. Although, obviously this place is more of a residential area than a place for shopping sprees. Um, and it would be nicer if I had a gym closer to where I live as well... Or a cheaper gym anyway, at the very least.Maria: What facilities are there in your area?Rory: Well, like I say, the gym, but it's very expensive, so I don't go there. I go to one that's further away and a little bit cheaper. It's almost exactly the same, though. I don't know why it's so expensive. Then there are a few shops for some foodstuffs and some parks. I suppose, maybe if I poke around a bit more I can find some new stuff.Maria: Do you know any famous people in your area?",
    discussion:
      "Rory: Not really. But then it's not like this place is a very well-off area or anything... So I doubt there are any famous people living here.Maria: Do you intend to stay in this area in the future?Rory: Well, I'll stay here for the foreseeable future or at least... Sorry for the rest of the year and then I'll move back to Scotland.",

Especially since I usually write in block capitals, for example.M: How did you learn to write?R: Well, I'm not sure actually. Usually, start when you're quite young. So those early days are sort of lost to the mists of time. I did read a paper though that said, there are stages where it's just nonsense of scribbling. Then words with correct endings, and then fully-fledged words.

      "Part 2 — A situation that made you laughMaria: Now, I’m going to give you a topic and I’d like you to talk about it for one or two minutes. Before you talk, you have one minute to think of what you’re going to say. You can make some notes if you wish. I’d like you to describe a situation that made you laugh. In the task it says: “Please say what the situation was, when it was. He also should answer the question, “who was there with him?”, and say why it’s made him laugh. All right. Remember, you have one to two minutes for this. Don’t worry if I stop you. I’ll tell you when the time is up. Could you start speaking now, please?Rory: Of course. The first thing that comes to mind, if I think of a humorous situation I’ve been in, is one time I was working at a summer camp with my friend John, and I was giving a briefing to him and the other teachers there. And I thought it would be a good idea if I got the teachers to pretend that they were a class of young people so that they could see how the activities were being done. And that would hopefully make them appreciate the instructions a lot better than if I just told them straight. However, what I didn’t reckon with was the fact that one of my friends, John, in this case in particular, decided to take the role play too far. And he, instead of completing the task, drew a funny picture of a cat, and he held it up for everybody to see. And at that point, everyone in the room just burst out laughing. It was… Like, we were hysterical. It was absolutely ridiculous. I think the main reason is because, well, we’ve been working together for a long time, so we’d bonded and we were all very comfortable with each other at that point. But in addition to that, we were working hard and I think a lot of us had sleep deprivation and we were really looking to release the stress and tension we were feeling. So it all just started coming out of people and we were laughing for like about five minutes straight before we could recover control of ourselves. I think the one of the other reasons that really got to me in that sense was also just the contrast with normality. We’d been working quite professionally with each other for, oh, gosh, about two weeks at that point. And then the contrast with normality, it just made everybody laughin addition to all of the other reasons beforehand.Maria: Okay. Thank you.",
    discussion:
      "Part 3 — HumorMaria: Now, we’ve been talking about a funny situation, and I’d like to discuss with you one or two more general questions related to this. Let’s talk about humor. Do you think a sense of humor is important?Rory: Oh, yes, it’s absolutely crucial. It helps you cope with stress. And I really think it helps people regulate their emotions. If you never laugh, then you suppress a lot of these feelings. And that can be quite damaging, actually. Another reason is that it helps you find common ground with people if you can share a laugh together.Maria: Is humor easy to translate from one language to another?Rory: I think practical jokes and almost slapstick comedy, because everyone can see it and appreciate it. That’s easy to translate. It’s not something that I like, but I think a lot of people can understand it. But for other elements of humor, like dark humor, not every culture can get that. I noticed, for example, that as you move further east from America, the humor tends to get darker and darker. And people… Until you come to Russia and it all seems like people are doing bad things to each other just “because”. So that can sometimes be something that’s lost in translation, I think.Maria: Can humor be useful in learning another language?Rory: I think in terms of teaching the language, it’s good if your teacher has a sense of humor because you relax more and then you’ll be more receptive, for example. But as a learner… I don’t know. I suppose it would take the edge off being stressed. Definitely.Maria: Do you think that when people laugh, it’s always genuine or sometimes people can even fake it.Rory: I think people do put on their laughter sometimes. I think you can tell because it seems to me that the pitch of people’s laughter can tell you a lot about her genuine it is. If it’s like a really really high pitch, almost unnatural, then it seems to me like it’s fake or less genuine.Maria: How do you think laughter can be used in a negative way?Rory: I think it’s combined with bullying. For example, if you’re laughing at someone as opposed to laughing with them, then you can use it in a very negative way, almost to lower someone’s self-esteem, really, And that’s not very nice.Maria: Do you think that the less people laugh, the older they get?Rory: Maybe not older, but certainly they seem to become more serious or behave in a more mature way. We usually associate people laughing and joking around with being less mature, maybe, more childish and younger. However, I suppose… Laughter also decreases stress in people as well, doesn’t it? So if you decrease the stress which can cause you to age, then actually maybe it would make you seem a little bit younger.",

      "Maria: Do you like sharing things with other people?Rory: It really depends on what those things are. If they have some kind of sentimental value to me then no, I don’t like to share them. But if it’s something that, you know, is not so valuable, then that’s fine, I think.Maria: What things do you like to share with others?Rory: Well, I quite like sharing books with people because I’ve built up quite a collection over the years, but there is not anywhere to put them really, so I wind up having to give them away, really. So it’s OK to share books in that sense, I think.Maria: Do you think it’s important to share?Rory: It’s like I said previously. Some things are quite important to share with other people. So we could talk about things like physical things, for example. We could also talk about things like space. You need to be willing to share space with other people. Or if we talk about work environments as well, then you need to be willing to share your ideas with other people as well. So in these senses it’s important to share. But there are some things that just cannot be shared. So for those things, it’s not so important to share them.Maria: Did your parents teach you about sharing?Rory: Well, my parents did partially. But I also grew up with several siblings as well, and they taught me about the value of sharing as well, in their own way.Maria: What are the things your parents told you not to share with anyone?Rory: Well, if we can be a little bit sappy for a moment, they told me not to share my heart with too many people because, of course, it’s important to share your life with someone, but only one special person.Maria: I’m deeply touched! Dear listeners, Rory is sharing his heart on this podcast.Do you think that more people will share cars in the future?Rory: I actually think carpooling is a really cool idea. And yes, I’m pretty convinced that it will be quite, well, more prevalent. Yes, that’s the word I’m looking for. You already have carpooling apps, but there seem to be more and more as time goes by. And the reason for that, I think, is money in the main because it’s cheaper when you share things. But also, there’s the social advantage as well. When you are meeting new people, when you’re sharing a ride, for example. So yeah…",

And of course, they’re domesticated animals, so you can always keep them quite close to you, and that’s really good as well.Maria: What wild animal do you like the most?Rory: I love big cats. In particular — Tigers. They really stand out with this color scheme on their fur. And then, of course, they also portray the sense of majesty and power as well when they are moving. It’s really interesting to watch.Maria: Have you ever seen any wild animals before?Rory: Yes, actually. I used to teach in a school in Africa, which was quite close to a riverbed. And so sometimes crocodiles would just wander into the school grounds, which was always very exciting.Maria: Crocodiles at schools?Rory: Yes, absolutely.Maria: Oh. Have you ever pet a crocodile?Rory: No. I don’t think you’d ever want to do anything like that.Maria: Well, what would you like to do that?Rory: If it was a domesticated crocodile and maybe…Maria: Could a crocodile be domesticated?Rory: I think you could maybe domesticate just about any animal.Maria: Rory, do you like to go to the zoo?Rory: I used to like going to the zoo more as a child. I think we still have that sense of wonder when we’re children. Whereas now, it’s kind of a double edged sword, because you can see the animals, which is great, but you are also quite sad because they’re in captivity, and that’s also quite sad. But what’s the alternative if they’re in the wild and they don’t have this protection?Maria: Are people in your country fond of animals?Rory: Oh, yes, definitely. The United Kingdom has this reputation as being a nation of animal lovers. There’s lots of different bodies which are dedicated to the protection of animals and helping them when they’re sick, like the RSPCA and the RSPB. It’s definitely accurate to say that people are fond of animals there.Maria: Have you ever kept a pet?Rory: I haven’t personally, by myself. No. Because I work a lot and I’m kind of allergic as well. So I’d need to find something that’s almost hypoallergenic, really. But when I was younger and I lived with my parents, then, yes, we kept pets.Maria: Why do some people keep pets at home?Rory: Lots of different reasons, really. I think one of the main reasons is because they’re cute. Of course, all of these domesticated animals look lovely. But in addition to that, they have some utility as well. Like dogs, for example, are kept as guard dogs to protect your property. But it’s not always about defense. People also keep cats and even goldfish for therapeutic purposes, for example. So there’s lots of different reasons, really. But I think those are the main ones, though.",

It makes me feel rather nauseous. It’s probably something I need to work on a bit more.Maria: Why?Rory: Because people don’t like being around impatient people, do they? It’s not a pleasant experience for you or the people that you’re with.Maria: When do you need patiencethe most?Rory: I think that’s mostly when I’m in situations where I constantly have to repeat myself. Of course if you have to say the same thing over and over again then it can become quite frustrating and then the frustration builds up and you start to lose patience.Maria: Rory, when do you need patience the most?Rory: I think I need it the most when I… Wait a second…????Maria: What do you become impatient about?Rory: Well this will be quite a stereotypical answer from a British person, but one thing that really irritates me that’s not connected to repetition is waiting for a very long time, especially in queues. You know whenever you’re on the Metro and you’re trying to walk up the stairs, but people in front of you are slowing down and you have to wait for them. That can be quite frustrating. And then I become quite impatient.Maria: What do you do when you get impatient?Rory: Well, if you’d asked me before I had a greater sense of what makes me impatient and what I can do to stop it, I would have said that I just become sarcastic and I just use sarcasm and irony until people get the point that I’m becoming impatient, and they start to speed up a little bit. But now I first of all resort to sarcasm, usually in my head, and then I try and calm myself down and remember that people don’t deliberately try and make me impatient. So, it’s about reminding myself that that’s the case and then calmly explaining again, for example.",

I guess that’s what you’d call them. Usually not skinny jeans. Although I am wearing them today.Maria: Did you ever wear jeans at school?Rory: No, not really. We would have them on dress-down or casual days. But usually we wore uniform. In fact, jeans were expressly prohibited. It was really a bad idea to have jeans.Maria: Rory, why do people wear jeans?Rory: Well, you can buy them everywhere. They’re in all of the shops. You could take a step outside right now and you could find them there. The other thing is, I think a lot of people wear them as a fashion statement. Certain brands like Levi’s, for example, are extremely popular despite the fact that they cost so much. And I think the reason why is it allows people to show off and express that aspect of themselves.Maria: Why are jeans popular all over the world?Rory: I think it’s partially connected to the fact that, like I say, they’re very accessible. Anybody can wear jeans, but they’re really quite an American product. And obviously there’s this ascendancy of American culture right now where this is, like, a product that shows that you’re modern and Western, almost like an American. And I think people really connect with that, so that would explain, in addition to the utility of jeans, also the idea of jeans, why they’re so popular around the world.Maria: Why do some people spend more money on jeans?Rory: It’s like I said, it’s a fashion statement, really, I think… I personally think that people spend too much money on some brands of jeans, but that’s their choice. And I think the choices based on the fact that it’s a fashion statement for them.Maria: Would you pay a lot to buy jeans? Be honest.Rory: I will! Normally, no. If you’d asked me that question before I went to Paris, I would say no, I wouldn’t pay a lot for jeans. I don’t like to spend that much. But when I went to Paris, my partner introduced me to a shop called “Weekday”. And there they had like really nice pairs of jeans. And I bought my first ever pair of skinny jeans and I’m wearing them now. And I think I look quite good in them.",

I think it’s included in your taxes, because it just comes straight from the water reservoirs in Scotland.Maria: Do you drink bottled water or water from water machines?Rory: Actually, I drink both, but it will depend on where I am… what I’m drinking. So, for example, if I’m out and moving around, then I will drink bottled water because it’s portable, for example. But I don’t buy bottled water regularly. I just usually just buy the bottled water once a month and then I’ll reuse this water bottle just until it wears out, basically.

I don’t think there’s like a specific amount for each person. I know there’s lots of advice out there saying six “glasses of water”, “eight glasses of water”… But for me, no, just drink as many glasses of water as you need. That’s my personal philosophy.",

      "Maria: Joe, do you live in a house or an apartment?Joe: I live in an apartment. I’ve been living there for about three months now. And it’s fantastic. I really enjoy it.Maria: What do you like about living there?Joe: I think the most important thing is location. I’m only about a five-minute walk from the Metro. And for someone like me who has a very busy schedule, the convenience of living so close to the Metro is probably the most important thing.Maria: Which is your favorite room in your home?Joe: I don’t have a very big home. So unfortunately, I don’t have much of a choice. But I’d say my favorite room is my bathroom. Because after walking through Moscow in a bitterly cold day, I love to get home and take a hot shower at night before I go to bed. So although I don’t have much of a choice, I would probably say that my bathroom is my favorite room.Maria: Would you change anything about your home? Why/why not?Joe: You know, that’s a really good question. Unfortunately, when I moved into my home, there was a lot of junk and rubbish in my home already, especially on the balcony. Things that belong to the owner and he just never took out. So unfortunately, my balcony is is very crowded now. It would be great if he would take those things away and I could have the balcony to myself.Maria: Would you like to move to a different home in the future?Joe: You know, I’m not the type of person that really thinks about the future. I mostly live in the present. But no, I suppose in that in the near future, I would like to stay in my home because as I said, the location is perfect. In the distant future… Oh, I suppose that that would depend on a lot of factors. As I mentioned previously, it’s a quite small apartment. So if I happen to have a family in the future, I would have to move, of course. But for the time being. No, my apartment is perfectly fine.Maria: What sorts of accommodation would you most like to live in?Joe: Well, you know, to be honest, this changes every day. It really depends on my mood or how I’m feeling. For example, sometimes in the middle of our Moscow winters, I really picture myself living in a tropical bungalow in some sort of warmer climate. But on the other hand, on most days I’m perfectly fine living where I am now. So like I said, it really depends on my mood.",

But everything seems to be working out rather well.Maria: When you were a child, did you think a lot about your future?Rory: I didn’t speculate about technology. I think most people speculate about this kind of thing. But I preferred to think about the kind of job I would have instead. And I focused a lot on that.Maria: Do people change as they grow older?Rory: Yes, I think so. Not just as a result of the biological reality. For example, as you get older, moving into your 30s, you’re capable of doing more. And then, of course, you change in terms of being able to do less as well. But also, you change in terms of experience as well. When you’re a child, you know almost nothing. And then when you’re older, you know a lot more.Maria: Do you think you’ve changed as you’ve got older?Rory: Definitely. I think I’m a lot more confident and knowledgeable now, compared to how I used to be. Although, if people ask me previously if I’d changed, I’d focus on the bad aspects. But now I focus a lot more on the positive ones.Maria: What will be different about your life in the future?Rory: I think my life will be more stable. Not that it’s unstable now, it’s just it’s a bit more hectic because obviously I work a lot. However, I think it will be more stable, generally. And then more specifically, I’ll have family with children and the home of my own.Maria: Is childhood the happiest time in a person’s life?Rory: If people were able to appreciate it better, then yes. But since they can’t because like I said, children aren’t very experienced, then not so much. I think it’s much better to live in the present moment and appreciate that now when you’re an adult and you’re able to appreciate that much more.",

It’s one of the names of a friend’s dog. My parents had a friend whose dog was called Fergus. So this is one of the reasons they chose that. They liked the sound of the name.Maria: Exciting! Does your name have any special meaning?Rory: Yes. So like I say, my middle name, Fergus, is after a dog. So it’s kind of like a family joke. But my first name, Rory, actually means red-haired. I have dark hair, so I’m not too sure what my parents were thinking. But it does have a special meaning.Maria: Right. Is your name common or unusual in your country?Rory: Actually, my name is both common and unusual in Scotland because it’s common in the sense that there are people called Rory, but it’s unusual in the fact that it uses the English spelling of the Scottish name. Like I say, this is because my parents chose it because it was easier to spell.Maria: If you could change your name, would you?Rory: Actually, I have changed my name. I didn’t change my first name or my middle name, but I did change my surname and I changed it from Duncan to Duncan-Goodwillie. Duncan is my father’s name and Goodwillie is my mother’s maiden name. So I wanted to have both of their surnames in my surname, as opposed to just one of them.",

You can bring them into your home, and they can do all kinds of tasks for you that before you would have to do just by yourself. So it’s great for saving time for saving yourself as well. So I think the more we have of robots in the home the better.Maria: So you’re positive about robots?Rory: Very.Maria: Wow. OK. Did you watch any cartoons related to robots in your childhood?Rory: I think so. I don’t remember anything specifically about robots but something that was connected to it was a program called “Button Moon” which was, again not a cartoon but it was a stop motion kind of animation and they had a robot on that show. So it’s kind of similar to it. It’s probably not a very good one though. I can remember it creeped me out a lot when I was a child.Maria: OK. Do you like the idea of robots helping you at home or driving your car.Rory: Oh yes! Both. Like I said, I think they’re great for saving time and saving your labor, so you can focus on other things. I just wish we had more of them and they were better developed. This is for the home of course. But when it comes to driving my car I’m not so sure just right now if I want them to do that. I know they’re testing this, but I would like to see them test it a little bit more before I trusted my life in the hands of a robot.Maria: Rory, would you like to have a robot?Rory: Would I? Yes, absolutely! Like I say as many as possible.Maria: Wow. So if you had like 10 robots at home you’d be very happy?Rory: Yes! As long as they were doing different jobs. If I paid for ten robots to do the same job then that would be a waste of money.Maria: Isn’t it a bit scary to have like 10 robots at home?Rory: If you’re as lazy as I am, I find it quite reassuring.",

It's not necessary for work.M: Do you like to wear shoes that are comfortable or good-looking?R: Well, I don't see why it has to be a dichotomy. Why can't you have both? Everyone's got different tastes, but I think those are the main ones that informtheir taste.

      "M: Have you ever had a pet?R: Not in a very long time. We used to have dogs, specifically Chow Chows. That's a Chinese breed. And we've had goldfish and we even had stick insects at one point. But now the closest thing we get is the occasional dog on holiday or the birds in the garden.M: What are* the most popular pets in your country?R: I think it's a toss-up between dogs and cats, really. They're just easier to domesticate. And there's a range of toys and foods to choose from. So if you'd like to accessorize, then that would be the pets for you. And people do. I also think fish are supposed to be quite common these days, because, well, in most of the houses I've been in, people have had a fish tank.M: What animal would you like to keep as a pet?R: I think I'd quite enjoy being a dog dad. They're very loyal, and they have seemingly never-ending reserves of energy, which would be fun. Unfortunately, I just don't have the time right now. Though hopefully one day I will.M: Where do you prefer to keep your pets, indoors or outdoors?R: Well, why not both? Especially if it's a dog, it needs to be familiar with being outside for going on walks and comfortable inside for being around people. If you mean where it would sleep, then I think it's best to be indoors since it's safer. I also think it's illegal to keep certain animals outdoors or outside all the time, isn't it?M: What's your favourite animal?R: Well, in terms of domesticated animals, I like dogs the best with, well, with them being a man's best friend and all. In terms of wild animals, I'd like large predators like tigers and sharks. I'm not really sure what that says about me. But I do think they look cool and they sort of project an image of controlled power.M: Would you like to have a pet in the future?",
    discussion:
      "R: Yeah, like I said, I'm a major fan of dogs. So if I can get one, then that would be nice. Or that would be great even. Otherwise, having a goldfish would also be quite calming. I even entertained the idea of having a capybara once, but I'm pretty sure that's illegal. And even if it wasn't they're animals from tropical areas, so it might be a little bit cruel to keep one in Scotland.M: Rory, thank you so much for your answers!R: Thank you pet!",

I do have one friend who's a bit Gothic, and he is really into dark tones. Although recently, his fashion sense has taken a turn for the brighter with more patterns using primary colours, and even some texture in the shirts, actually, which is nice.M: What colour was important to you when you were a child?R: I think I had a pretty simple grasp of colours if I'm honest. Probably just primary and secondary ones, like the national colours and those embellishing the emblems of our country.M: Do people in your country like to wear bright colours?R: I think they tend to be darker actually, if we consider like, for example, most tartans are on the darker end of the colour spectrum. So lots of darker tertiary colours. Then again, if you saw our family tartan, you would think the opposite.M: What colours would you never use in your home?R: I was thinking about this recently, actually. And I think the really bright ones like almost luminescent would make me feel ill. But most colours, most other colours would be welcome as long as they match the decor.

I often flit from one task to the next without any sort of logical order to it, which isn't good for getting things done quickly. But I still do get them done. So perhaps it isn't such a big deal.M: Are you easily distracted?R: I suppose that depends on what the distraction is, really. Generally, I'm quite good at shutting out loud noises and background goings-on. However, if there's a message notification in front of me on my phone, then I'm almost compelled to investigate. That and I already mentioned that other tasks will distract me. So it's sort of a competition of productive tasks.M: What do you do to stay focused?R: Well, I like to think I'm generally a responsible, hardworking person, and I'm quite task-orientated. So I like getting the job done. Those character traits more than anything keep me working away until things get done. Plus, I like to imagine what I can do once all the hard work is out of the way.M: Why is it difficult for some people to stay focused?R: There are all kinds of reasons. I suppose the main ones are that they have a lot going on in their lives, and it's hard to prioritize, or they might have difficulty prioritizing in general, due to compromised executive function. Others have just never been taught the skill of working at things until they get done. And they give up after a very limited period of time.M: What improves concentration?R: Generally, a lack of distraction is the most useful thing. So if you have a minimalist approach to things going on, then you could probably focus more. At least that would be how it works in my case. You can also remove things that are drawing your attention away from what you should be doing. Or you could move yourself if you can.M: Is it good to do several things at the same time? Or is it better to focus on one task?",
    discussion:
      "R: Well, I think that's probably dependent on what it is you have to do and the kind of person you are. I mean, sometimes it's fine to just jump around from one task to another rather than chip away at one thing, especially if it's taking an eternity. On the other hand, there might be tasks that are particularly urgent that need to be done right away. So obviously, if you can do one thing, then focusing on one thing will be quite useful in this sense.M: Thank you, Rory, for your focused answers!",

Of course, good in my conception of things as sort of decorative in an older style. Maybe like Victorian, or Edwardian, or massive modern skyscrapers in the big city are also cool.M: Are there many buildings where you live?R: Well, I should hope so since it's a city. And there's quite a range to look at. We live in an old fisherman's cottage that's over a century old. But there are newer, more modern buildings just across the roads. Further into town, they're even older residential and commercial buildings. Actually, I think some of them are even listed buildings.M: What kind of architecture do you like the most?R: Well, like I said, older buildings from around a century ago have a good look. You can find them in the city... Well, you can find them in city centres of most Scottish towns. I also like the Russian styles of design from the czarist, Soviet and post Soviet periods. They all have this sort of massive look to them, but it varies from time period to time period. So that's interesting to see.M: If you could live in any home in the world, where would you live?R: Well, I quite like to live in, well, really any of the older buildings in Arbroath. That's an old resort and fishing town to the north of my actual hometown. It seemed better days in most ways, but the harbour site in coastal areas are very aesthetically pleasing in my opinion. The older buildings are made from cut sandstone, which gives it a reddish look, and they all have like really large interiors with high walls, which I quite like as well. So I would choose to live there.M: Is architecture an important part in the cities identity?R: I'm not sure about cities, but they're definitely part of a national identity. Though now I think about it more, certain cities where I live have their own look actually. Aberdeen has buildings made of granite. So they're like very grey and greyish colours and tones. Glasgow has lots of blocky buildings crammed in all over the place. And Edinburgh is quite elegant. So perhaps it is on reflection.",

I mean, if we mean as a passenger being driven somewhere, then it would probably be to the nursery this morning for my placement. As a driver though I imagine the route I took when I took and ultimately failed my first and last practical driving test.M: Where do you like to sit in a car?R: Well, ideally, wherever is the most comfortable. Usually, that's in the front passenger seats. Since I can avoid any motion sickness and speak to the person driving. That is unless it's a taxi, as I really hate speaking to taxi drivers. Sorry, any taxi drivers listening to us. But I just want to sit and listen to music when that happens.M: Is driving common in your country?R: I would say so, yes.

In more deprived areas that might be less so but it's not like cars are an uncommon sight even at that.M: Is it hard to learn to drive?R: Well, since I've yet to pass my test, I would certainly say so.

But it's not exactly the worst thing in the world, although you miss out on the popcorn, but at the same time, you don't have to wait in line for the tickets, for example.M: How often do you go to the cinema?R: Well, like I implied before, hardly ever these days. There's just too much to be getting on with. So spending time sitting in front of a giant screen isn't the best use of time, or at least I think so. If I had more time than I would.M: When was the last time you went to the cinema?R: I can remember it vividly, actually. I took my other half to see Godzilla vs. Kong at this huge mall where we used to live. The whole plot was ridiculous and the characters were inconsequential. But I did like the experience of eating popcorn and laughing at how silly everything was. And thankfully, the rows of seats were mostly empty. So it was okay to laugh out loud. Usually in the cinema, there's this sort of convention or unspoken rule that you don't make too much noise but we could, which was good.M: Did you usually go to the cinema when you were a child?R: Oh, I definitely used to go far more often when I was younger. There wasn't much of a choice, frankly, since my parents did all of the decision making in that regard. Based on what I can remember, though, I did enjoy myself. We used to watch the Disney classics, for example. So yeah, we went and we went fairly often.M: Do you like to watch films alone or with your friends?R: Oh, I think it depends on the movie, really. Well, I like watching my favorite movie, which is Contact, by myself. Because it's a film that's designed to provoke deep thinking, which I think is best done alone. On the other hand, there are some films which are just mindless fun like Starship Troopers, which you should definitely watch with friends just to enjoy the insanity of the storyline and the setting. However, if we think about the cinema, then that's something, that's almost always a collective experience, isn't it?

      "R: I think that depends entirely on how I'm feeling as it is for other people. If I feel nostalgic, then I'll watch an older film, even if I've seen it millions of times before, like what we talked about Disney classics, for example. Or if I'm feeling like something new, then I'll see what my friends are recommending. Most recently, I developed a taste for found footage films and mockumentaries, which are either quite mysterious or humorous. And that's quite good because they're, well, you get engrossed in the plot, and you can lose yourself that way.M: Thank you, Rory! You are like a film star! You're the star of our podcast!R: The star of vocabulary and grammar. Unless it's conditionals. My New Year's resolution was not to learn more about conditionals.",

      "M: Rory, do you remember your dreams when you wake up?R: Well, not usually, unless they've been particularly vivid or memorable. It's normally a case of going to sleep and then just waking up feeling well-rested. Oh, unless I've had lucid dreams, because then you can remember everything that you did in great detail, because you were actually in control.M: Do you think dreams affect life?R: Well, they probably reflect life more than they affect it, in my case. I remember someone arguing once that dreams are your brains' way of problem-solving. And the dreams I can recall in most detail revolved around something that was playing on my mind the day before. Does it affect my decision making in the real world, though? Not that I'm aware of. Usually, I'm quite conscious in my decision-making process.M: Do dreams have special meaning?R: I suppose they can, if you decide to assign some meaning to them. For me, it's more about getting sleep and resting my brain and getting up again. I don't really tend to dwell on dreams, or what they might mean for me. I can see how someone might believe otherwise. But in my case, it's rather straightforward.M: Do you like listening to other people's dreams?R: I haven't really had the chance, to be honest. Though, I suppose if someone really wanted to tell me then I'd find the time to hear what they had to say. It could be an interesting insight, but it's hard to say for sure. Because it doesn't happen to me very often.M: Do you share your dreams with others?R: Do you mean do we have the same dreams? Or do I talk to other people about them? So if it's the former, then sometimes I see people I know in my dreams, but we've never had the same experience, which makes sense because it's my brain that the dream is happening in. Or if it's the latter, then I don't usually see the point beyond saying I had a really weird dream about so and so, and that's it.",

      "M: Do you want to learn more about dreams?R: Not overly so. I have a lot of things on my plate right now that I need to study. And so I don't really see this as a great use of my time. Maybe if I had more time I'd feel differently but not right now.",

Actually, what I find quite useful as an English teacher who works with English learners and sees their struggles to get better at speaking is called SmallTalk. It's basically a free virtual AI, like a speaking assistant, that helps students improve their spoken English. One thing that I particularly like about it is that it has an IELTS speaking simulator, which helps predict students IELTS scores.M: What websites are popular in your country?R: I imagine the same ones that are popular elsewhere.

It was always a bother to make things realistic or colour inside of the lines. Since then, I've made sporadic attempts at learning and trying to draw, but nothing formal in the sense of actual lessons.M: Is it easy to learn how to draw?R: I think that depends on how much time and patience you have for it. In addition to whether, well, you have good teachers and role models. I had none of that. So it wasn't very easy for me. Although I do remember a time when I was very young, that it just came naturally to me. I'm sure it does for some talented people, but most of us just have to work at it.M: How often do you paint or draw?R: Well, like I say, I sometimes doodle and scribble in lectures, but that's about it, really. I can't remember the last time I made a serious effort to draw something or someone. It must have been years ago when I was trying to depict a character from one of my books.

So that just means these are the easiest things to draw. But mostly there is no pattern. It's just random shapes.M: What do you know about painting?",

But if you wanted to talk about the history of art or how to critique it, then you'd be out of luck because I'm a novice in that respect.M: Thank you, Rory!

So that would be things like scenic views of my home for my friends who live abroad, or ones of keepsakes that are a bit too bulky to carry with me.

We also have some physical albums around the house that are organized by certain events or themes, but usually, they're just organized by the times they were taken.M: Do you ever delete or throw away photos if they are on paper?R: Well, if they're, I don't know, redundant or ruined, then there's no point keeping them.

Like, I know there are about 200 countries in the world and I've only seen about 30 of them, but I think that's more than most people. So I would say so.Maria: How long was the longest trip you took?Rory: Uh, well, I suppose Russia, technically speaking, because I was only supposed to be here for a year. But here we are five years later, and I'm still going strong. Probably after that, the second longest one was Sweden for Erasmus, which is like a scholarship exchange program in Europe. And then I spent seven months away in the mid 2000s traveling around Africa and East Timor, which is a small island off of Indonesia. So I suppose you could say I'm used to these sort of long haul adventures.Maria: What kind of places have you visited?Rory: Oh God, all kinds! I've visited developed and developing countries, active war zones, savannas, rainforests, islands, mountains, coral reefs. It would be easier to talk about the kinds of places I've not visited yet. I think my favorite places are usually by the sea. But I took a short trip to Kurdistan in northern Iraq and that was completely landlocked part of the world.... That was a once in a lifetime experience I'll treasure forever, even if it did get me put on a watch list.Maria: Do you think it's better to travel alone or with other people?Rory: Well, I almost always travel alone. It gives you a bit more autonomy and freedom of action. I quite prize that. So, that's good for me. I can still see the advantages of traveling with someone, and hopefully, one day I'll find that person who's an ideal traveling companion.Maria: What do you do while you're traveling?Rory: All kinds of things. I've been free diving and I wrote a few books while I was away and I read a lot of books. I've read a lot more than I've written. I go out and I talk to strangers and have adventures. Of course, I do traditional things like tasting the local cuisine and sightseeing, but I try to balance this with some more unique experiences as well. And meeting new people is definitely more unique than just seeing the sights.Maria: Would you like to have a job that requires traveling to other countries?Rory: Well, I kind of do, or I did, at least. I've been around the block for work for a few times, though I wouldn't really want to do it regularly, since it's quite hard on you.",

God, the list goes on, actually.Maria: Is family important to you?Rory: Extremely important. It's great having so many people around you with their different life experiences. They can be great founts of knowledge and comfort and support. It's not all taking, though. There is some giving. You get to contribute to that long family history of people doing the same thing, contributing to the history. And that can be immensely rewarding, I think. I suppose the last thing I would say is that I'm extremely proud of every last member of my family, from the youngest cousin to the oldest great grandparent. Everyone in my family has done something really worthwhile with their lives. So I think that's really important.Maria: Tell me about your favorite member of your family. Who do you admire?Rory: I don't believe in favorites. Um, some people that I know do have them, but I think everyone in my family is absolutely worth looking up to. There's nobody who I would dismiss as someone who's, like, disreputable. Um, but if I pick one example in particular, then I would choose my grandmother who worked all by herself during the war while her husband, my grandfather, was fighting. And she raised four highly successful children by herself after he died. And she never complained and never stopped being kind to other people. And she was really active in the lives of her grandchildren. I think she set a great example for my mom and her siblings to follow, and they are all brilliant people because of her and her husband.Maria: Who is the oldest member in your family?Rory: Well, I think, in my close family, I suppose that would be my father Ian, though out of politeness and respect, I will not say how old my father is. If we speak about my family as a whole, then probably one of the older cousins is in her 90s, I think.Maria: Do members of your family ask you for help? What do they ask you for?Rory: Oh, well, actually, I think I ask them more than they ask me, frankly speaking. But I do get the occasional request for help in terms of information about what I do or where I live. So, for example, my cousin wanted to know more about living and working in Russia because he's thinking about studying Russian language at university and he should, he's extremely gifted with languages. Um, I have another cousin who wanted to work with me here because she's completely mad. But to be honest, I think they both do very well for themselves. They're both very bright young people. I think they'd have a ball in Moscow.Maria: Are you happy to help your family?Rory: Well, if they ever needed it, I'd be happy to give it. However, to be honest, most of us are pretty self-sufficient and self-reliant. It's not a common thing for us to ask or need financial support, for example. Maybe, perhaps, emotional or informational support are the varieties that are most commonly given in our family at least.Maria: Do you have a family, not your own that you like, and why do you like them?",

      "Rory: I can think of many, actually. The example that stands out the most is my friend Anna, her family are quite spectacular. They are extremely welcoming and hospitable people and they really make an effort to make you feel involved in what they're doing. For example, if you walk into the kitchen then they'll give you something to do and they'll talk to you while you're doing it. It reminds me of my own family back home, except with a Russian twist to it. I often think about how different the world would be if there were more people like that in it.",

And then I suppose on certain dating apps, I talk to different people, which it doesn't always turn out romantic, actually. But you can you can still make friends on these things, I should say.

I'm not a very shy person, obviously, and I don't mind chatting for a bit, although it's ending the conversation that can be a bit problematic because I usually have work to do. So I need to... well, I just need to get on with it, so it can sometimes end things a bit prematurely. But usually there's no reason why we can't keep speaking online later. So it's like I said, with people, they can find me on Instagram if they ever bump into me in public.Maria: Do you have difficulty talking to strangers?Rory: Erm only if there's a language barrier, so, for example, if we talk about Russian. A lot of Russian speakers are functional and not conversational. And so I can communicate basic ideas, but not very complex ones, which can put a bit of a damper on things at times. And that's a problem.Maria: Is it difficult to tell a story to a stranger?Rory: Uh, I suppose it depends on what the story is, doesn't it? Um, so usually I'm quite good at, well, just telling stories, but sometimes I get a bit carried away and leave out important details because I'm so excited to tell it. Um, usually it's nothing you can't recover from though. And once you realize that you've left something out, then you just quickly add it in.Maria: Are you afraid of being judged by strangers?Rory: Uh, I used to be, but no, I don't really care at all. The people who know me well and my friends have chosen to be my friends. So their opinions are the ones that I'm more interested in and I value more in general. Um, I suppose nobody wants to be disliked, but, um, not but but and it would be a shame if people were to fall out with me over something inconsequential, even if I don't know them very well. Although when it does happen, ultimately, I just ask myself, will I really care about this falling out in five years time when I have my dream life? Probably not. Um, and there's little to judge me about anyway, so it's not exactly a pressing concern.Maria: Do people in your country often talk to strangers?",
    discussion:
      "Rory: Oh, yeah, we're a very friendly bunch. Come to Scotland if you can. Yeah, we have freedom, freedom to talk to strangers. So, yeah, we're a friendly bunch. And I think Scottish people are generally more open and positive about new people than in a lot of other places. One reason could be that we have pretty good social cohesion and a lower population. So we could feel a lot bolder when we're amongst more of us, for example. And of course, it could also be because a lot of people in Scotland are quite heavy drinkers and don't know what we're doing half the time. So there's that as well. Maybe a lack of self awareness.",

They don't tend to have things that I'm really interested in. Usually I buy various bits and pieces online unless it's a book or a trinket for people back home. But like I say, that hasn't been for a while.M: When was the last time you went to a street market?R: I honestly can't recall. But if I were to guess, randomly, I think it was when I went to Haiti. And there was a collection of stalls and tables by the seaside. And they sold gifts based on seashells and things like that. You had to haggle over the prices, which I wasn't good at. But it was why I remembered it because I remember the merchants being really annoyed with me.M: Are there any street markets in your country?R: Well, probably not as many as there used to be after the pandemic, but you do see them from time to time, especially farmers' markets in the villages or small towns.M: What do people usually buy there?R: Well, I'm hardly an expert, but I think a lot of them sell local foodstuffs and handicrafts. Of course, you can have small stalls and tables with just about anything, but it seems like those would be the main good sold.M: Do many people go to street markets in your country?R: I honestly wouldn't know, but if I were to guess then I would say they would if they were given an easy opportunity to.

That's especially true when I work in a new place and I leave things lying around. Sometimes I have to set reminders on my phone to tell me where they are actually. What should people do to find what they lost? Well, like I said, maybe setting reminders in advance of the realization would be a good thing. But I think most people, like retrace their steps through the day and try to work out where they were, when they put whatever it was they lost down. If they can't do that, then they try to do something similar in their mind's eye.M: Have you ever found anything?R: Not in a while, but I have before. I think the most recent one was I came across someone's change that they'd left behind without realizing. So I left that with the receptionist at the gym that I was in. And hopefully they returned it to the right person.M: What things do people usually find?R: I've never really asked, to be honest. Keys and phones are probably the most common since they're so widely used. And they're small enough that you could lose track of them. But then again, I've seen people forget where they left their car before as well.M: What should people do, if they find something?R: Try to return it, of course. If that's not possible, then you can usually hand it to someone who can help, like the police or, or you could put up a notice to show that you found it.M: Is it okay to keep the thing of the person you found?R: Well, you keep it safe, obviously. But you should always try to give it back. If it's relatively inexpensive or not very valuable, like a lighter than I think it's moderately socially acceptable to keep it. I used to come back from a few nights out with like, several lighters, and no one ever bothered me about it.",

Although, I can't stand cakes with fruit in them, for some reason. I think there's something about the texture of dried fruit that I just don't like. But in general, yes, I do like cakes.Maria: Do you like sweets more now compared to when you were a child?Rory: Well, I think I liked them more when I was younger, since I wasn't aware of how bad they are for me and people in general. So it was kind of like an unadulterated joy to eat them all the time. And no, it's more like a guilty pleasure, because you know, you're enjoying it, but of course you shouldn't be because it's bad for you.Maria: Have you ever tried to make sweets or cakes?Rory: I did when I was a child.

Um, I think when I go back I'll be doing it more often though, since I want to reconnect with nature and the people in my life and the countryside seems to be the ideal place to do that.Maria: Who did you visit in the countryside?Rory: Well, now, I visit my friends, they have a house there next to a forest, and I have to say it's one of the most magical places I've ever been to. It's kind of a quasi orchard and vegetable garden in their backyard and their front yard is paved so you can soak up the sun there in the summer. There's sort of a ditch outside the house as well. It's like a moat. So it just adds to the general country atmosphere in combination with everything else. Although it's not all about the surroundings, though, it's mostly about the people and how they live and how we are together.Maria: What do you like to do in the countryside?Rory: Anything that involves my friends, um, we go for long strolls in the forest, throw parties, meet cool people. Um, there are some more mad things like bonfires as well sometimes.Maria: Have you ever lived in the countryside?Rory: Not for a long time. Um, uh, when I lived in Timor in Ghana, I spent long months and weeks in the rural areas, rural areas, sorry, in the well, just around the country, basically. And that was quite liberating and life moved at a much slower pace than in the city. I'd recommend it to ..I don't know anyone who wants to slow down for a while.Maria: Would you like to live in the countryside in the future?Rory: Oh, definitely. Who wouldn't want to live there? Um, I have this idea of buying a small house in a sort of village to the north of my hometown and settling down there when it's quiet.Maria: Have areas of countryside in your country changed since you were a child?",

And there are lots of estates springing up there now, which is rather frustrating in a way, because, well, really is there's really little need for these things. If people didn't buy second homes, for example, and they were just satisfied with the accommodation that's currently there. And really, what do you need a second home for? Um, it's almost like it's eating into the legacy that I'd like my children to have. A lot of people want their children to have that legacy. Um, I suppose the counter argument is that people are more likely to look after land that they own. So it might be more manicured. But part of the fun of being in the countryside is that it's quite wild, isn't it? Um, so I have this sense of foreboding about these changes.",

But I'm not a great fan of dancing wildly at clubs or doing the tango, for example, it's first of all takes too much coordination and I'm really clumsy. It's like I have two left feet or something. So it's not something that I do to a great extent I suppose.Maria: When was the last time you danced?Rory: Probably ironically in the club, actually. I can't remember. I hardly ever dance these days. Well not when I'm sober at least. I think I went on a date once actually and we danced doing that. That was quite nice. It was a little bit awkward because of course I can't dance but it was nice. I've not done anything like that before.Maria: Has anyone ever taught you how to dance?Rory: Many have tried but all of them have failed. You'd have more luck probably teaching me advanced physics I think. I think some people have this natural rhythm but I just don't. So it's if you like sort of successful in tasks then why not try.Maria: Why do you think some or many people like dancing?Rory: Lots of reasons. It's a good way to exercise. And it's like a mode of self-expression. People use it to attract people they're interested in. Although admittedly I can't remember finding anyone enticing based solely on their dance skills alone, although it's possibly because I don't share that trait.Maria: What kind of dancing do people in your country like?Rory: Ah well I don't think there's a limit. I suppose in clubs there's like the usual tunes that people dance along to in their own way. But I think people dance to anything don't they?Maria: Tell me about any traditional dancing in your country.Rory: Oh god! Highland dancing. Okay I should explain for people who don't know about this. First of all Google it. It's fun and try. Highland dancing is like folk or traditional dancing everywhere. In terms of the complexity and coordination it's I think it's quite well known relatively.

I think that's how it works. But the main ones are obviously Christmas and New Year. We call New Year Hogmanay. And then we have Saint Andrew's Day, which is like the day for our national saint, our patron saint. May Day, which you have in Russia also. In January, we have Burn's night when we celebrate I think we celebrate the birth of our national poet, Robert Burns. I'm sure it's his birthday. And then we have something called the Tattie holidays, which is well, it's a break in about October time where people used to go and pick potatoes. It sounds strange, but it makes sense in context.Maria: which public holiday do you like the most?Rory: When I was younger, I used to like the Tattie holidays when we got a break from school late in the calendar year. But now I'm all about Christmas. I love the idea of being together with my family and sharing that time together. Um, it's a shame it won't happen this year, but I'm compensating with a combination of online conferencing and face to face well-wishing with friends.Maria: What do you do during public holidays?Rory: Well, unless it's Christmas, I'm usually chilling out and forgetting the world exists and resisting the urge to go out and get absolutely leathered. I think it's important to have time to relax well. And like when I say relax well, I mean actually relax, not do things like people do things in public holidays and sometimes they shouldn't. They should just chill.Maria: Do you think these holidays are important?Rory: Oh, absolutely.

That's our word for lake. And different kinds of coastal scenery to enjoy. Even near my home, there's a burn which is like a small river, and you can walk by that, if you're careful with the gore species, it's like tamed nature pervades the place.

But it's not usually a problem because I'm hardly ever in my room when I'm traveling at least, and there are always sites to see close by. So it's not something I worry about too much.Maria: Do you enjoy visiting places with beautiful views?Rory: For me, it's always more about who I'm with rather than where I am or what I see, but I don't think I've been anywhere really ugly. Even the more industrial areas of Russia or Scotland have something about them that makes them an interesting sight to behold. Although there's a beautiful view if anyone's been to Romania from the People's Palace and that looks over the city and that is absolutely spectacular. And I would definitely recommend people who enjoy visiting those kinds of places go there.Maria: Would you like to live in a house with beautiful scenery around it?Rory: Oh, I think that's pretty much the law in Scotland. Even the industrial states, for all the problems that are associated with them, are quite pleasant to look at. I'd like to live in a town called Arbroath back home. That's near the sea, and there are some good cliffs to look at well, from this town. And then you can look out at the water from them, too. I think that's quite beautiful.Maria: Why do people like taking pictures of the scenery?Rory: Not by the people, like taking pictures of anything. It's because they like what they're looking at and they want to have this memory of whatever it is they're seeing. So why not? It's always nice to have a memento. I think there's an expression.

But I also take the Metro more. So on balance, it's probably roughly the same amount of walking, but the travel is over a greater distance.Maria: Do you like to walk on your own or with others?Rory: Well, if it's with people I like and we aren't in a rush, then of course.

So it's not usually a big deal.Maria: Would you say that your city is a good place for walking?Rory: Well, if we're referring to Moscow, then absolutely! You have to walk everywhere unless you're rich and then you can just get driven around places. This place is gigantic. Even with the assistance of the metro, there are sometimes 10 to 20 minute walks to where you want to be, at least. Back home in Scotland in Dundee... That's also good for walking actually, though, people would prefer to walk along the beach or in the hills rather than in the city itself. But there are still some nice places to walk in the city, I suppose.Maria: Do people in your country walk a lot?Rory: Well, going by the size of some of them, they don't walk often enough. I say that there is something of a trend to go walking these days. Some people I know like hill walking or mountain climbing and they might walk to work or walk around town in short bursts, but they could definitely afford to do it more often, I would say.Maria: Do you think you'll keep walking as part of your routine in the future?Rory: Well, as long as I have a pair of legs, I would definitely say so. Perhaps not as a hobby or a sport, but as a means of getting around for sure.Maria: Do you think walking in the countryside is better than walking in the city?",

You've got to be super prepared, don't you?Maria: Does is the weather affects your mood?Rory: I suppose it depends on how sleepy I am. It's quite cozy when the rain is battering down and you're in bed and you're away to sleep. Of course, if I were out in there, I would feel completely differently. So I suppose the general principle is it affects my mood in proportion or relating to how much it wrecks the peace and quiet of my life.Maria: What do you usually do on sunny days?Rory: I like to go for walks and listen to music by myself. It's nice to just enjoy the sunshine and the rear. Well, the rare opportunity to get a tan when you can, whether it's in Scotland or Russia. Of course, some people go overboard and take their tops off with no protection and then they get horribly burned. But I think I tan quite well.Maria: Do you often use sunscreen?Rory: Oh, actually, not at all, but please don't do that if you're listening to this and do not do as I do, but rather do as I say and wear sunscreen. I'm actually the only person in my family that could tan well, for some reason, everyone else I know gets horribly burned or they get burned quite badly and they need a high SP factor cream. I don't know why that is. It must be some sort of genetic anomaly, but I don't advise people to go out without any sunscreen because it's quite dangerous, actually.Maria: Do you like rainy days?Rory: If i'm inside and not out in the rain then it's not so bad. Usually these days are for sitting inside and doing something spiritual or intellectual, like meditating or writing, for example.Maria: Does rain ever affect transportation in your hometown?",
    discussion:
      "Rory: Not generally, though. There is a bridge near my house in Scotland that gets partially flooded in the rain and cars have to drive through it really carefully or well, their engines will get flooded as well. Other things, like getting a bit muddy can be a problem. It's usually not a big deal, though, unless it's like torrential rain. And even then, the worst we've had is some water in the kitchen. We live near a river, so maybe the haar in the morning in the summer might affect boats' ability to navigate. But it's never caused significant problems before. So not really is the answer.",

      "Maria: Rory, can you sing?Rory: Um, well, I think everyone can sing, really, though, in my case, I just can't do it very well. I think it's like someone is trying to murder a cat in the room or something. At least that's how it sounds. Then again, maybe it's just the acoustic sound very good. Of course, that's exactly what someone who isn't very good at singing would say.Maria: Do you like singing?Rory: I like trying out where no one can hear me, or at least no one I know. I often do it when I'm on my way home after the gym and I'm feeling a bit pumped and more confident, although God knows what people walking past me must think, I don't know. I don't think I've really got a good vocal range so I can only sing like really common songs or popular ones.Maria: Do you want to be a singer?Rory: I used to and I realized it wasn't much good at it. And when I realized that I kind of let that particular dream die, I think that's OK, though, if you let go of things like that. Although when I do have my occasional flights of fantasy, I do imagine that I could be a singer one day.Maria: Did you enjoy singing when you were younger?Rory: Well, we always used to sing hymns at school assembly and that was always good fun because you could join in with the others and usually it would harmonize, at least to a certain extent. And then we had choir songs sometimes when we went to church. And that was also quite good fun.Maria: How often do you sing now?Rory: Well, like I said, every time I come back from the gym and sometimes when I'm alone in the office, I'll hum something to help me concentrate or deal with stress or, well, I already said it helps me with my focus. So I guess those are the two main reasons.Maria: Do you have a favorite song you like listening to?Rory: Uh, well, yes, I actually have this habit of listening to things until they get so boring that I can't listen to them anymore. So right now, I quite like Ellie Golding. It's almost like a spoken word version of Elton John's \"Your song\". The use of instrumentals and vocals and autotuning is quite relaxing and good to listen to. So like I say, currently, I'm listening to that song to death before I move on to the next one.Maria: How important is singing in your culture?",
    discussion:
      "Rory: Um, it's a good question and it's probably important for people who are into that. Um, if you're well, for example, if you're in a church choir, it could be considered a key element of the religious experience at church, for example. Uh, we also have lots of voice coaching places and singing skills. So I think it's quite important for people in my country. It's not the most important thing for me, but for a lot of people, they seem to quite like it.",

But the rest of us are like sardines in cans in the rush hour, unfortunately.Maria: What traffic problems are there in your area?Rory: Well, just rush and traffic and driving in general really, rules are selectively followed and enforced and the roads are sometimes packed. Then there's this rush to the metro in the morning and then you have the rush hour in the evening time as well. You're lucky if you can get a seat, actually, especially if you're a man. Mercifully, I'm only a few stops from where I get the bus. So it's OK for me, but it can still be quite annoying. And it's the same with most kinds of public transport, to be honest with you. Some of the ladies I work with have this propensity to save a seat for their bags because they should never be left on the floor, apparently, which means it's always a struggle to get a comfortable spot, regardless of whether it's public or private transport seams sometime.Maria: Are there more traffic problems now than in the past?Rory: Well, there's more traffic in general there, so I imagine there's been a proportionate rise in the number of problems, but maybe the seriousness has decreased compared to before because we have more safety measures, like everybody's got improved seat belts and there are airbags. Actually, as it turns out, windscreen wipers weren't invented initially with cars. They had to be invented later on. So, yeah, all of these technological improvements probably mean that maybe there are fewer problems. Maybe.Maria: Do you think there will be fewer traffic problems in the future where you live?Rory: Well, the infrastructure in Moscow is always developing. So I think the trend I mentioned earlier will continue where I am at the local level too.Maria: How do traffic problems affect you?Rory: Well, aside from slow traffic and struggling for a seat, not tremendously, my schedule is quite flexible and I've learned to live with standing, so it's not a major issue for me.Maria: How would you reduce the traffic problems in your area?",
    discussion:
      "Rory: I think the only way to do that would be to have fewer people, but then the side effect with that would just be spreading the problem around or increasing the problems over a wider area. I think it's better to flow around problems than try and solve them. So I spaced out my schedule, find things to do while I wait and just be generally more patient with people.

      "Maria: Rory, how would you define happiness?Rory: Well, there are two parts to it, in my view. The first is an absence or relatively lower level of ill feeling, and the second is an abundance or a relatively higher level of positive emotions about a situation. I think you need both to be truly happy.Maria: What usually makes you happy?Rory: Snuggles? No, seriously, when I stop working for a second and reflect on my life and how far I've come and everything I've achieved and all of the great things that are happening right now, I almost can't describe the feeling of exhilaration that I feel. And then when I get to enjoy the benefits, like the ability to sleep in on a Saturday morning, not today when we're recording, but usually... and then I get to help people all over the world. It's bliss. I love it.Maria: What would you do to make you happy?Rory: Well, I'm already quite happy. So it becomes a case of how to maintain that, which isn't very difficult. It's things like avoiding difficult situations. And I have enough life experience to foresee potential problems. It's almost like a gut feeling, now. You can kind of look at a situation and see when things are going awry or could potentially go awry. And if we speak about maximizing happiness, maybe it would be meeting and sustaining life goals, like, having a family and finding joys in that develop. This is in addition to seeing my circle of friends. They make me pretty happy, even though they're all very different people.Maria: Do you think people in your country are generally happy people?Rory: I think that most people, most places, most of the time are quite happy, or at least they're satisfied with their lives. The two are often conflated, actually. It can't be a 100 percent. Otherwise, there's no impetus to move forward. Despite everything. We're living in quite an extraordinary time with great potential for improvement and development. I think I read somewhere that people in the West, which is where Scotland is, are less happy than they used to be for varying reasons. And you can see elements and glimmers of this when people speak about mental illness and dissatisfaction with the way things are more often. But it could be that we're just more aware of these things. So I'd like to air on the side of cautious hope in this case. I think we're quite happy people.Maria: What kinds of things make people in your country happy?Rory: Things like family and material comfort and a sense of meaning that scaffolds all of that, these are pretty universal things. But if you want me to pick something specific about Scotland, we had this reputation for being a bit feisty and working hard to get what we want. And when we do it under these conditions, then we're happy. That's my opinion. Others might beg to differ , of course! Russian people are quite feisty, for example.Maria: Are people in your country happier now than they were 30 years ago?Rory: Well, people said that rates of happiness were going down, but my understanding is that they're probably about the same, but for different reasons. And the threats to happiness have probably changed as well. We're more individualistic now, so individual achievement is more likely to produce happiness. We're also in the limelight a lot more on social media. So this plays a role in determining how happy people are, whereas before it didn't because you weren't... it didn't exist. It's sort of a paradox, because while we all want to be seen as individuals, we crave the approval of the crowds to keep going. However, since more people are looking after their mental health, now, I think we are happier despite some counter indications.Maria: What makes you feel unhappy?Rory: Well, any kind of physical or emotional pain, the worst for me is that I feel like I'm unable to progress further. So I was a little down a couple of weeks ago because I hurt my ribs at the gym. I thought I had actually cracked my ribs, but it turns out I just had a spasm, so I had to lay off it for a little while, which retarded my progress a bit. But I recovered because I reminded myself that it's not a race and I got back in the saddle easily enough.Maria: What do you do when you are unhappy?Rory: I try to analyze the situation and see what the problem is. Obviously, there's like this initial reaction of like, oh, I'm unhappy, but then you can't just stay there. You have to move forward. And usually I can just avoid being upset by things, by reciting a few mantras in my head. I suppose sometimes if the unhappiness is more persistent is because I haven't eaten or slept in a while and I'm hungry and tired as a result. And when you when you understand that, you can pinpoint and tackle the cause. Um, and of course, I'll vent to my friends. Everybody does that. It's good for decompression.Maria: What's the happiest moment in your life?",
    discussion:
      "Rory: I mentioned a while back, actually, someone special met me off the plane when I came back to Russia a few years ago, and I wasn't expecting them to do that. That wasn't the reason why it was special. It was because I really loved them. It was nice, this feeling of someone caring about you and they care enough about you to set this whole thing up completely under the radar. It was like quite a surprise. And I often think about that moment. It's sad because it's over now, but I'm glad I had that feeling at least once in my life.",

So I would say yes, and I think I'm a lot at that.Maria: Are there any important trees in your country?Rory: That's a good question. Well, my cousin works for the Forestry Commission. I at least I think so. And they would probably they should and would be better placed to answer. Well, I don't think they're any individually important trees. I would say that forests are an important part of the national heritage and beautify the country to a certain extent. So while there are no important individual trees, groups of trees exist that are.Maria: When was the last time you went to a forest?Rory: Well, the school I work in is in a forest, sort of, so I suppose just last week and there are a lot of evergreens like fir trees there that shelter the buildings and local wildlife, which is quite cool.Maria: Would you like to go to the forest if you're free?Rory: I don't see why not. Being around nature is quite relaxing and helps take the pressure off. If you have the time, though, you might say that about having time more generally. So if somebody could drive me to the forest, why not?Maria: Is there forest near your hometown?Rory: Quite a few, I think. We have a lot of parks like Camperdown and Vinicky near trees in abundance. I'd like to go to them when I'm back, actually.Maria: Would you like to live in the place that has a lot of trees?Rory: Well, I live in Russia and I'm from Scotland, so I would say that I already do and I already have lived there. Russia has massive forests. You could get lost in there. I think someone said once. The reason why Russia doesn't need to guard its border with China because the forests are so huge and inhospitable.Maria: Did you ever climb trees when you were a child?Rory: Yeah, and it gave my dad no end of grief when my brother and I did it. He always used to say we would break our backs falling out of it. That never happened, though. I always wanted a tree house as well. But we never quite found the time to build one, actually.Maria: Do you think we need to protect trees?",
    discussion:
      "Rory: I think we already do, don't we? Yeah, there are lots of laws about these things back home, though. I think there are still problems. At least in Russia. There are problems of Chinese companies over-harvesting forests, for example, and there's a more international problem of acid rain. Like I think there was a problem between Germany and Sweden once the acid rain from Germany was landing on Swedish rainforests. So that's still an issue. And they would be you know, it's important to protect them since trees are so vital to us being able to live. So, of course, we should protect them. So the short answer is yes, and we should do it more often if we don't already, in addition to balancing that with the other economic concerns we might have.",

That usually means that the notes section of my planner is like overflowing, but at least I know what I need to remember.M: Did you have a good memory when you were a child?R: Oh, not in the slightest. I had a memory like a sieve. And I'd have forgotten my head, if it weren't attached to me, probably.Has your memory changed over the years?R: Oh, absolutely. Mostly due to having to deal with the consequences of having a bad memory. So I used to get in trouble for forgetting things, for example. So after that I would reflect on the situation and think how can I prevent that from happening in the future? And what I would do usually is things like make a note in my diary or set an alarm, and you can set reminders on your phones. I haven't done that in a while, but that's one of the things that I do or did to change.M: Is it important to have a good memory?R: I think it used to be, since you couldn't record everything with as much ease as these days. But now we have computers and phones and other things to help us, well, to help us out, so that you don't need a good memory so much. You don't need it as much as you need good organizational skills, perhaps. So if someone tells you something, then you can write it in your planner or you could put it in your phone. I think actually some phones have this like algorithm or it's an automatic setting where if someone sends you a date, it underlines it and sets up a kind of hyperlink. So you press the hyperlink and it opens up a page in your planner on your phone, and then you can input all the details there. So it happens almost automatically by default on your phone.",

      "M: Do you like to visit museums?R: Um, actually not overly so. I just suppose it might be a fun idea for a date, but I wouldn't go there as part of a hobby or something like that. I think they're a bit boring and dull, to be honest with you. It's not exactly something that I would enjoy doing just by myself.M: How often do you go to museums?R: Like I said, um, not really very often. I'm not the biggest history buff these days, although I used to be. So I think I went to the last museum was probably in Volgograd or something like that. But I usually prefer books these days. Like I said, I'm not a big fan of museums at all, to be honest with you.M: Are there any museums in your hometown?R: Actually, yes, there's loads. There's this old jute mill called the Verdant Works, which showcases how, well, fabric was produced back in the Victorian era. And then on the subject of the Victorian era, there's the, I think it's the RMS Discovery, which is an Antarctic exploration ship, which was captained by, well, Captain Scott. It was recovered from Antarctica after they got stranded there. So it's a museum now and there's loads more besides that. But that's not such a surprise because it's the fourth largest city, so a concentration of museums is to be expected.M: When is the last time you visited a museum?R: Well, I said it was Volgograd there, but actually, I just realised that after that, I went to the state historical museum with my friend Lena in... Well, the state historical museum is in Russia. And I think it was about two years ago now, actually. It was, it was a very poignant experience. On the inside there are loads and loads of pictures and portraits of monarchs long since passed. For example the members of the royal family and the, well, the aristocracy in general, really. And the ones that were of the last royal family in Russia were quite, they had quite an emotional impact because, of course, you understand what happened to them. But on the flip side, it was also kind of entertaining because there were translations from Russian to English on the plaques next to them. And that was quite funny because of all the mistranslations that had happened. And to be honest with you, it was really, they were really silly mistranslations. Like if I had been asked to do the translations, I wouldn't have made those mistakes.M: Did you visit museums when you were a child?R: We used to go to the Natural History Museum quite often. And in Scotland, when you're younger, I think it's the same everywhere, to be honest. You have school trips to different museums. So I talked about the verdant works before when I was talking about the museums in our hometown. There was lots of excursions there, I suppose so, yeah. It was definitely a much more common experience when I was younger. Now it's not so much because I have less time and different things to do at that time.M: Do you think museums are important?",

They are like key treasure troves to whatever nation they belong to as a whole, particularly if you talk about children. That's why they exist to impart this knowledge to the kids.",

But they will never be my thing. It's something that I share with my mom, not really having a head for numbers.M: Is math difficult to learn?R: Extremely. I can't describe how it feels to any great degree of accuracy, but I can just feel my eyes glazing over and my soul begs for all to end whenever I encounter math or any mathematical equation. I think it's just the effort of creating the abstractions in my head. I can do this with words, like I'm good with language, but I can't do it with numbers. That area of my brain seems to have completely atrophied by now.M: Do you think math is hard?R: Well, for me personally, yes, but I didn't have terribly good math teachers when I was younger. That wasn't their fault entirely because I wasn't a good student either. And the whole situation of math education just wasn't well suited to me learning it, to be honest with you. More generally, though, at least at the basic levels of arithmetic, it shouldn't be so torturous for people, especially young people in smaller classes like you can do some sums in your head, for example.M: When did you start learning math?R: Oh, primary one, I think. That's our equivalent to the first grade. We had to learn times tables by heart and do long division. Not in primary one. I think that times tables came a little bit later, but we started doing like basic addition and subtraction in primary one. But it was all learning by rote and it was all very dull and it was useful for basic arithmetic with money and things. But beyond that, it wasn't terribly... We didn't have much utility.M: Who taught you math?R: Oh, my teachers mainly. My mum and dad tried to help, but I think they were as frustrated as I was by the end of it, to be honest. The information just wasn't digestible, no matter which route we took. So I think this was why rote learning was basically the only the only route that we could take.M: Did you usually use a calculator?",

So in summary, less work and more people will be in my life.M: What are your future plans?R: Well, in a nutshell, get into primary teaching and have a quiet life with a partner and two and a half children and a dog. But to expand on that, I need to do a university course and hopefully that will be next year. And then after that, I'll see how that works out. And it all depends on whether I like primary school teaching or not. And if I like it, then I'll stay in Scotland. And if I don't like it, then I'll need to go back to English teaching. But that's OK because I like English teaching as well. Either way, hopefully I'll have the time to buy a house and live there and do whatever work I set alone there.M: Are you worried about your future?R: A little bit. One of my fears is that I might not get to meet my children or grandchildren, having passed the point of no return for that to happen. And I think I still have a bit of time before I hit panic stations, though. So it's just a small worry, but it's not...

Um, I think well, there will always be things that could be better, but I'm hopeful that everything in my life will be positive for the most part.M: What challenges do you see for yourself in the near future?R: Well, I think probably the greatest hurdles to overcome will be finding a partner and maintaining a stable job while having a family. I think about it often, but it's not really something you can do much about until you meet the other person in your life that you decide to have children with. But it is a thing that comes up increasingly. Not just in my life, but other people I think are facing this challenge as well.

For example, in terms of exercise, I used to think it was important to work out every day and then I realized it's actually important to have some rest days to promote muscle growth and recovery. So now I have weekends off.M: What do you do when you take a rest?R: Bit of a nerd, actually. I watch videos on YouTube or I read comics and chat to my friends. I'm lucky that I have people like them actually who are pretty chilled out and they agree that relaxing is quite an important thing to do. A lot of people are like, you need to work all the time and you must be busy and doing things. But I'm lucky my friends understand the value of some me time.M: Do you take a nap when you have a rest?R: No, although I can see why siestas and catnaps are popular, but I always feel really unwell when I do that, so I try and avoid it. One solid block of sleep is enough for me. Although and I do get it, it's like seven to eight hours. That's fine.M: How do you feel after taking a nap?R: Like I said, I'm not a huge fan of them.

They're really welcoming and they create this air of warmth in a household, which is really nice to have.M: Did you have any pets when you were a child?R: Well, like I said, we had two of man's best friend, and numerous goldfish, and small creatures.

You can see them everywhere. And cats are also a common sight in our neighborhoods and the surrounding neighborhoods as well. As our fish, although the fish will be outside in their fish tanks.

It's the kind of combination that sort of makes your insides vibrate at the same time they're being crushed out of existence.M: Do you often go out in the evenings?R: Almost never if I am honest. Unless I'm going to the gym and shopping and then walking back. Does that count? I think the last time I was in a club was about a month ago, and it was like being in a time warp.

Hence why bars and clubs are annoying because you can scarcely hear yourself think. It was easier when I smoked because you could always nip outside and speak to people there. Now I have to sort of yell over the din to make myself heard. I think the last time I was out I just sat and spoke to random people, including the barman, actually.M: Do you prefer going out on your own or with friends?R: Does anybody go out by themselves?

But if we speak more generally about times past, then, yeah, they did. Not just for fun either. People would go out walking, or jogging, or they would take dogs for a walk.

That's probably a side effect of a growing population, increased levels of development and the invention of new technologies.",

      "M: Rory, let's talk about time management, shall we? Do you ever change your plans?R: Oh, constantly. Well, there's an expression about life being what happens when you aren't making plans or something like that. So you have to adapt to change, or that could backfire.M: What's the hardest thing about making plans?R: I think that depends on what you're doing. If it's something by yourself, then you have to cope with unexpected changes in your schedule, if it's planning with others, then probably having to deal with conflicting agendas even. So in a nutshell, probably just the change and chaos that's part of life in general really, or coping with it.M: What's the latest plan you made?R: Well, this is exciting, actually, because I've organized a trip with some of my friends to the south of Italy for a week. We had to book flights, and, well, booked the hotel rooms as well, around the same time as each other. So that was interesting. As well as finding out about the different kinds of documents we need. It's all taken care of now, though.M: Is it easy for you to manage time?R: Usually, though, I suppose the thing is, you're never really done with everything, are you? There's always something to do. So while it's manageable, for lack of a better word, it can be demanding.M: Do you like being busy?R: I suppose it helps take your mind off things and focus on, well, the task at hand. Plus it's good to get things done. But I don't like being busy all the time. It's essential to have some downtime to recuperate from, well, from time to time.M: Are you ever late for anything?R: On occasion, yes, but it's never hugely so. So maybe like five to 10 minutes or fashionably late as I think it's called. Usually it's not more than that, though, since it's kind of rude to waste other people's time, isn't it?M: Do you think most people can manage their time well?R: Unless they're Russian, by and large - yes. Although some people who aren't very orderly probably struggle more than others. Then again, they're usually more creative. So there's a trade off there.M: Thank you, Rory, for your...",

And even then I only really have a look in the passing. I don't have a great deal of time for it these days.M: Do you like to watch live games?R: Oh, I think the last time I did that was when I was a child.

And then just the general atmosphere is not something I want to be part of at the moment.M: Who do you like to watch sports games with?

But certainly if there were people that were playing a game that I liked online, as unlikely as that is, then I would probably watch it.M: Did you do any sports when you were younger?R: To varying extents yes.

Still you do see people heading off there from time to time, probably to justify the expense, to be honest.M: Where do most of your friends work?R: Well, I think the majority have pretty hands-on jobs.

Some of them still work in offices, but that's a rarity these days.M: Would you like to design an office?R: I could probably do the basics, like what I would want, but the more technical aspects would be lost on me.

Plus, I don't have a clue what I would make an app for.M: What kinds of apps will you use in the future?R: Well, I'm not a fortune teller, though, I'd imagine I'll keep on using messenger apps, though they might change, will always need to communicate. I doubt I'll use any of the gaming ones since I don't think they're a productive use of my time.

I also like looking at the recent event page on Wikipedia. That tends to be fairly neutral and sort of captures the essence of big events.M: What was the last article that you read about?R: I think it was something about the education system in Scotland and how people were questioning its effectiveness.

I just like the watches with a long lasting strap and battery, maybe with a backlight function and waterproofing for emergencies. But that's about it. It's not anything very comprehensive.M: Is a watch important for you?R: Like I said only for some parts of work when a clock isn't readily available. And even then it's less for me and more of the people I'm working with since we need to coordinate things.M: Have you ever got a watch as a gift?R: Yes, as it happens, I was given an analog one with a blank face and a sort of heavy leather strap by my grandmother on my 18th birthday. It's long since stopped working but I keep it as a reminder of her and our friendship.M: Why do some people wear expensive watches?R: I suppose it's a status symbol or a part of fitting in with a particular community that values such things. You can signal the kind of person that you are that way and it makes for an interesting conversation piece if you run out of things to talk about, I suppose.",
    discussion:
      "M: Do you like expensive watches?R: I don't really like expensive anything, to be honest. I've had cheap watches that lasted for ages and I never had any problems with them. Quite why people are so invested in their timepieces. I have no idea since there are otherwise sane and rational people.",

But if we narrow it down to the most common and general things, probably storing and communicating information. I mean, for example, everyone uses some sort of messenger app, and I keep all the evidence from my university work on my phone.M: What kinds of computers are popular in your country?R: Well, I'm hardly an expert. But if I were to guess I would say that laptops and desktops are probably quite commonplace. If we include it to less traditional options, then satnavs are sort of computer as are the ones on your phone, and everyone has one or the other, well, or both?M: Who taught you how to use a computer?R: I was thinking about this the other day, actually. And I think it was a combination of self-teaching and exposure to computers from a young age. Everyone starts by plastic around with a keyboard and mouse. And then you get a simple system or program and see what happens. And ultimately find a specific purpose to use the thing for, whether it's just playing games or working properly. I don't remember anyone ever explicitly teaching me anything specific.M: When was the first time you used a computer?R: Oh, God, that must have been over 20 years ago, when I first got a computer for. It's a computer for, sorry, it was a computer for kids from my parents. It just had a few simple games on it to help you get used to the idea of actually using a computer. It wasn't one you would recognize today. It just had the small LCD screen that was more reminiscent of a watch that a computer.M: What would your life be like without a computer?R: Well, that's a bit like asking what life would be like without lighter or plumbing. It's so embedded in everything that I do. Life would be different beyond imagining. The easy answer is to say that it would be worse or more boring. Though, I think in many ways, it might actually involve more reading and imagination. It's hard to say to any great extent, like I said, though.M: Do you think computers have changed your life?",

I like putting together plans and lists, and then I do a lot of free writing in my spare time.

So perhaps that's an inherited trait. They were also both journalists. And perhaps that's where the talent for storytelling comes from. Now that I think about it, my brothers are quite similar in that way too actually.M: Do you think your talent can be helpful for your future work?R: Well, I would certainly say so. It's already come in quite handy for teaching and writing books and articles. And I imagine it will do in the future when I have to put together plans and lessons and teach writing.M: Do you think people in your family have the same talent?R: In terms of the amount of contributes to work?

So I definitely say that I'm a morning person.M: What do you usually do in the evening?R: Oh, I think I'm very boring. So I work until about 8:30. In the evening that is.

I didn't play any sports at all. And I actually made an active effort to get out of PE class when I could. That's a bit unfortunate, really, since I really liked exercise in later life, but our PE classes were pretty dire.

There are also a few old jute mills, which were...sorry they've been repurposed, but they're kept in their original state because they're listed buildings.M: Do you think we should preserve all the buildings in cities?R: Assuming they're kept up to code, then I don't see why not. It's a good reminder of the past and a connection to culture that pretty much anyone can access. I visited one of the first mosques in Africa, which was preserved as part of their local history in that area.

That's who they're for after all.M: How do old buildings affect the appearance of a place?R: I think that depends on their upkeep, really.

But with the cost of living these days, such as it is, it's quite expensive to go out. So it's easier to cut out the middleman and enjoy each other's company in a familiar space.M: Do you think there are some places that are more suitable for meeting people?R: Well, yeah, you wouldn't meet anyone in a volcano? Would you? On a more serious note, though, it'll depend on the purpose of the meeting. And, well, I suppose the nature of the company. For example, you wouldn't meet a friend you hadn't seen in a while in a loud shopping centre. You wouldn't be able to hear each other speak. Unless that was the point, of course.M: Why are some places better than others?R: Well, probably the point of meeting people or the point of meeting people is so that you can hear them. So in a noisy place, it's not exactly great, or the acoustics aren't great for hearing people and what they have to say. So that's why a quieter place might be better. On the other hand, maybe you've got friends who quite enjoy excitement. So something like an amusement park would be a great place to meet because that's the purpose of being there.M: How have meeting places changed compared with the past?R: Well, I'm hardly an expert, though, if I were to guess I would say that they're more numerous and they exist in a greater variety than before. Although, ironically, fewer people are probably using them these days and just opting to meet at home in light of the fallout from the pandemic restrictions and everything else that's going on.M: Are there any differences between your favourite places now, and in your childhood?R: Well, I'm probably less likely to meet friends at a play park, for example. Although I teach young people, so actually, that might not necessarily be so true. So I think they're probably more mature, like, and sedate. Like cafes, for example, as opposed to when I was younger, when it would be wilder things like, I don't know, you'd bump into people when you went wandering around in the street, for example.M: Where did you last meet your friends, Rory?

And apparently, you need lots of maths and physics. Even in primary, we did some isolated experiments here and there.M: When did you start learning it?R: Well, in the UK, your formal education and science begins in primary school. However, I was reading sort of small science books for children even before then and outside of school as well. It's a shame I never really got into it after all that reading. Well, after all the reading I used to do, actually.M: Did you like science classes when you were a child?R: I think I preferred reading about science more than actually doing it, to be honest with you. The classes were always very dry, formal and boring compared to the, well, relatively more bright and exciting books. So it put me off the subject quite a bit when we actually had to do the practical stuff.M: What was your favourite and least favourite science subject at school?R: Well, I always did well in biology. Chemistry was always a nightmare, because, well, there's maths involved in that as well, especially in the more complex experiments that you had to conduct. I didn't really bother with physics, because that was even more math-centric. So I couldn't tell you about that.M: How do you use science every day?R: Well, to be honest, I doubt I or anyone else outside of a lab actually does. We use the end product of science more than the process itself. For example, I know how a light bulb works, but it's my knowledge of other things that lets me work to be able to buy one, and then a different set of knowledge that allows me to flick a switch to turn it off.M: Do you think science classes are important?R: I think that depends on what it's in comparison to. So if it's in comparison to Maths and English, then no, it's more important to be generally literate than scientifically literate, if you have to choose between the two. It shouldn't be a choice. But when you have a limited amount of time to work with, it's better to work with more broadly applicable knowledge-based than something that's more narrow, or narrower, I should say.M: Do you think school children should have both science and art classes?",

It's maybe easier to talk about the ones I like such as the Iron Brew adverts, which usually have some sort of borderline offensive humour going on that's always edgy, or darkly funny, or offbeat. Most ads are not like that, though, which is why I don't like them.M: Do ads influence your choice of products?R: I think once or twice I bought something because it was supported by someone I followed on social media. I have a few shirts as a result of doing something like that. Otherwise not really, no. If anything, they negatively influence it to make me not want something. Take those miracle supplement ads, for example. Everyone knows the sports people in them are taking steroids or something else to make them cheat. Why would I want to buy something from someone being dishonest when I can work hard and take pleasure from that instead?M: Is there too much advertising in our life?R: Honestly, any advertising is too much advertising. I think you should just let people look and find by themselves using whatever search criteria they come up with. Although, I'm probably being a bit utopian about that since I'm quite independently minded and many people are not. And there are some genuinely quite nice adverts. I like the Stellaris 5th anniversary trailer, that's got good music.M: Why do companies advertise their products?R: Well, in short, to make money, and in more detail to make more money than they otherwise would as, well, they otherwise would if they just let people look for things by themselves. I mean, if the branded beans have a catchy tune and an advert compared to the store-branded beans, then people are more likely to be influenced to go and buy the snazzier version, even though it's just about exactly the same product.M: Is advertising important?R: Well, it depends on what we're talking about. Advertising executives would probably say so, yes. Since it's, well, their whole business to create these things. And they're also sporting industries and graphic design which benefit too. But it's not like they would cease to exist without advertising. And it's important for consumers to make an informed choice.

I also have this assortment of different things I've picked up over the years. It's not exactly systematized or anything, nor was there any forethought to it. But I definitely have collected stuff.M: Are there any things you keep from childhood?R: Aside from the keepsakes I talked about before? I don't really have anything, but my parents do. It's actually quite extensive. It goes from, or it includes old school books to work, to things I made outside of school. I think I should probably take more of an interest in it. But I haven't had the time lately.M: Where do you usually keep things you collect?R: I've got a memory box for my own stuff. It's not very big. But there's about 20 years worth of assorted bits and pieces in there. It started overflowing recently though.

And I guess the same goes for old video games.M: What are the benefits of collecting things?R: Well, it gives you something to share with other people, like in terms of, or being conversation pieces. And I think if you've got them arranged in the right way, then it can add some character to your own interior design.",

So it definitely features in my day, I would say most of my days, probably.M: Is sending emails common in your country?R: I would imagine so, since you usually have to contact stores or colleagues via email. Messaging isn't very common by the telephone. Sending messages in a messenger is seen as a bit more informal and very few people text these days.M: Do you think sending emails will be more or less common in the future?R: I'm not sure. Like I said, about messengers, they're becoming certainly more popular. So maybe they will overtake email as the main form of communication. But we still have radios and telephones despite email existing, so I doubt they'll disappear entirely.M: Do you prefer texting or emails?R: Neither, to be honest. Texting is a bit outdated and emails are always so long. Messaging is much easier and more direct. You can even check messages have been read or whether there are not, in most cases.M: Do you prefer to have an email or a card for your birthday?R: I'm not overly fussed, to be honest. Just the fact someone took the time to send a message on my birthday is good enough for me. I suppose email is relatively more environmentally friendly by comparison, but that's about the only advantage I can think of.M: Will emails replace letters?R: Probably not entirely. Like I said before, radio didn't replace telegraph messages completely. And ebooks haven't replaced regular paper books. So they'll probably become more commonplace if they haven't already, but totally eclipsing letters is unlikely.M: Thank you, Rory, for your answers!

So when you message you use some apps to send a message and kind of we have texting and messaging.R: Yes. But we won't mention any specific examples, unless they want to contact us so we can advertise for them.M: True. Yeah. Okay.

Messi, Messi, if you want to sponsor our podcast, we would like that very much.R: Well, we would like the money very much...M: Rory, we don't care about the money.R: Selling our souls down the river and the cause of advertising on the other hand,M: Rory, just stop talking, Rory.R: This podcast has turned me into a revolutionary.M: Yeah, you know, like, three years ago, Rory didn't use to have an Instagram account. He didn't know what Facebook was. Just three years ago. Look at you now.R: Look at me now conspiring to bring down capitalism. That's what social media will do to you.M: Emails, right? Back to email. So we send emails, we also send documents to different people. So what else can we say? We send emails, we receive emails, we send them again, we check emails, we check emails at night, we check them the first thing when we wake up, maybe.R: You can talk about copying people in or blind copying them in. And that's just when you add people to the email send list.M: And also, when you send an email, you attach certain documents. So it's kind of convenient, in terms of you can attach things. Yeah, but also you can do it in a messenger. So yeah. And then, is sending emails common in your country? So it's common. And also you've used commonplace?",

So I imagine my future home will be adorned with endless bookshelves and storage space. Anything else would be the responsibility of whatever poor unfortunate is living with me.M: Do people in your country enjoy redecorating their homes?R: I have absolutely no idea. I would imagine so. Given how often people post about things like that on social media. But that's just a few 100 people I know. I suppose it's better to be houseproud than not, though, so I would say yes.M: Thank you Rory for your decorative answers! ",

Yes, they have gaudy clothes.M: Yeah, it's kind of like yellow jacket, I don't know, red dress, green shoes. Blue hair.

I'm a very go-with-the-flow person, which means what? You go with the flow.R: That just means that I just, I don't get overly stressed about things.

He explained why. So we're happy with that, right? So the examiner will just move to another topic. And there you can give a bit longer answers. But in terms of the length, so we were fine.R: Actually, to be honest, these answers, the length of them is probably about appropriate for part one answers. Usually, mine are a bit longer just so I can cram in some vocabulary. So they're okay.M: Yeah.R: I think.M: How much should I say in speaking part one?R: Maximum two or three sentences?M: Two or three. Yeah, but really just answer the question right? If you give like two sentences, and that's it, you can't give anything else, that's fine. Two or three. If you're giving more, the examiner will just stop you. How much do I say? As much as it takes. Cars. Rory uses cars to get him where he needs to be. Right?R: And as opposed to... Unlike most people who do not do that.M: Yeah, and you just compared to other people who like them as a hobby, right? So do I like them like I would a hobby? No. So cars are not a hobby for Rory. It's just a form of transport. Cars or vehicles, forms of transport. Yeah. And what cars do you like? And Rory, you said that I don't really follow the latest models. Models of cars, right?R: So if you know... If you have a particular kind of car that you like, then you could talk about the model, and that would be the type of car. But if you're like me, and you're totally ignorant, then you can drop the word module in there. And there you go. Some topic-specific vocabulary for talking about cars, and you didn't even need to try that hard.M: Yeah. And then you can say a couple of things about the brands. So Rory, okay, let's do this. I'm gonna give you the brand of a car, but I'm going to mispronounce it. So I'm going to say it in the wrong way.R: Oh, God.M: And you should give the correct pronunciation.R: I should, but will this actually work? Let's see.M: Yeah, okay. Ferrari. Ferrari.R: Ferrari?",

You don't overly notice them most of the time unless someone is holding them in their hands. But you would certainly notice if they were absent, so I don't go out of my way to enjoy art, but it is nice having it around or floating around in front of me.M: Have you ever visited an art gallery?R: Once or twice? I think the last time was in late 2019 at the Tretyakov Gallery. I think they had the \"Apotheosis of war\" on display at the time, which was interesting. But I didn't go out of my way to go to these places, and I don't regularly. So the art you're holding right now is all of the exposure I've had in the last few months.M: Which do you prefer, museums or art galleries?R: To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of either. But if I had to choose, it would probably be museums, at least there's some variety in the things to do and see there. But in the case of an art gallery, it's a lot of looking and talking, which I don't find to be very productive or meaningful.M: When was the last time you went to an art gallery?R: Like I said, it was around November 2019. And I only remember that because of the events around that period. I think we were on the cusp of a full global pandemic at that point.M: What did you learn on that day?R: I learned I don't really like art galleries, regardless of how famous they are, to be honest, I wish I could be the sophisticated sort of person that can get into these things.

I have stuff to do.M: Hmm. And art, we mean, kind of any, any forms of art. For example, I have this nice photograph. It's a photograph by Yann Arthus-Bertrand.R: That's not a real name.M: No, no. Seriously, it is a name. Yeah, it's Yann Arthus-Bertrand. And it's a hut in New Caledonia in France. So it's actually like this. So is this art, like if we kind of, it's a photograph? Is this also art?R: I think so. I should point out, right, the answers here, if you like art are not particularly helpful. So it's worth mentioning different kinds of art that you could talk about. For example, Maria's art is a good example of landscape art. In the same way, you could talk about portraits. You could talk about historical fictions, seascapes, starscapes, any kind of scape, really, including escape the art gallery, because you're bored, which is what I would do. So those are just a few things that you could say, to be honest. Then we could talk about different styles of art. For example...M: Modern art.R: Modern. Classical.M: That's it. Ancient.",

It's just because I have other things on my mind, to be honest with you.M: Do you like doing word puzzles or number puzzles?R: Well, ideally, neither. But if I had to choose one, I suppose it would be word puzzles, because they most closely match up with my area of expertise, which is English. I suppose working out my finances is enough of a number puzzle for me.M: Did you like doing puzzles when you were a kid?R: I think I used to, but I had more time to finish them off back then. Whereas now I don't really because I've got all these jobs to do. Working out how to finish a Rubik's cube or to put together a jigsaw takes ages for me.

But that's just an example.M: Do you think it's suitable for older people to do puzzles?R: Well, I think they're the ones best place to do it, since they have, well or they usually have more free time on their hands and they have more experience. Although now I think about it, young people are always putting up or posting pictures of their wordles, aren't they? So maybe we shouldn't rule them out entirely.M: Hey!

So it's difficult to make out the solutions. It's difficult to find the solutions. But you could say the same thing about anything. Like in foggy weather, it's difficult to make out things in the distance. So it's difficult to see things in the distance too.M: So we make out solutions, right? A phrasal verb. But what do we do with puzzles? We do puzzles, we complete puzzles. We what?R: I talked about it later. I said to fill out a crossword, which is another way of saying that you complete it as well. But you can also fill out forms so if you were ever asked questions about writing, then you could say I need to write when I have to fill out a form.M: Fill out a crossword, do a puzzle, complete a puzzle. And a crossword is a kind of puzzle, right? What other kinds of puzzles can you talk about here? You can talk about jigsaw puzzles.R: I was gonna say I, mentioned jigsaw puzzles, and Rubik's cubes as well. I think those are the big ones that I have experience with. But you have logic puzzles as well like Sudoku, for example. It's where you have to match up numbers and squares. I'm not really explaining that very well. But you've seen this before.M: So yeah, crosswords, jigsaw puzzles, Sudoku. So these are all different kinds of puzzles. And also, you can talk about these wood cubes or something. This is pieces of wood, and you arrange them in different ways. So yeah, word puzzles and number puzzles, right? And, Rory, you said that, if I had to choose, I choose something like word-based puzzles.R: Or just word puzzles.M: So like crosswords?R: Yeah, crosswords are word-based. What else is word-based? Hangman? That's like a word-based puzzle or a word-based game that you play.M: Is it a puzzle? Hangman.R: It is. Because you have to work out a solution. So, and it's usually entertaining.",

      "M: Rory, does your name have any special meaning?R: Well, everyone's (name) has a special meaning, don't they? Mine describes the qualities of being red-haired and connected to royalty, well, my first name does. And then if I think about my family name, we have a family motto connected to it, which means learn to suffer. So make of that what you will.M: Do you like your name?R: Well, almost everyone does, don't they? Actually, there was a brief time when I wanted to change it to something else. But now I appreciate it for the unique thing that it is.M: What name do your parents or relatives call you?R: Just the first one unless I'm in trouble, in which case, it's my full name. Although I think that's true in a lot of places, isn't it?M: Would you like to change your name?R: Well, like I said, I used to want to change it. But that was just a phase. And I don't want to anymore. But even if I did, in Scotland, you don't have to do anything special to change your name like a deep pole or something like that. It's one of the few countries where this is not a requirement, actually.M: Does anyone in your family have the same name as you?R: No, I think that would be a bit confusing, wouldn't it? I've never quite understood why some people are named after their fathers and their mothers, to be honest. It just seems like a lack of imagination.M: Are there any differences between how people name their children now and in the past in your country?R: Well, I suppose there are more names to choose from now, aren't there? And more old-fashioned names seem to have, well, fallen out of fashion, for lack of a better term. There also seem to be fewer nicknames as well, but that's just my opinion. I don't know if that's an actual fact or not.M: How do people choose names for their children?R: Well, you have to ask them, wouldn't you? I know my parents went with traditional Scottish names, because that was something that worked well for them. But I'm not sure that's something that's true for everybody, is it?",

Rory Fergus Duncan Tequila Godzilla Goodwilly. I'm just adding random names to your name. So just for the fun of it. You have four names, why not six?R: Six seems excessive, at least in Scottish culture. But then how many names do you have? Four?M: No, I have three. I have my first name Maria. Then, no, actually, Molashenko, that's my surname. Maria, my name, my first name, and the middle name. Sergeevna. So three names. Easy,R: Although your middle name, it's got a different logic behind it to mine. My parents picked my middle name as a fashion statement, which means that it's not done for serious reasons. Whereas your middle name is done for different reasons, isn't it? Like if we talk about how children are named in Russia.M: Yeah. Just because of my father. He's Sergey. So I'm Sergeevna. So just after my father.R: Yeah. And there's a word in English to describe this as well. It's patronym. And I think it's the same word in Russian as well, isn't it?M: Hmm. So patronym? Right? Or the middle name.R: Not quite. Patronum doesn't mean your middle name. It means it's the name from your father.M: Ah, okay. What's the middle name?R: The middle name is just... It can be a name that's given for religious reasons. Or it can be done as sort of a fashion statement. It's something about class, for example, or about aspirations.M: Right.R: It could also be a nickname.M: Oh, a nickname.",

And that's despite the shelter provided by the hills behind it.M: What's your favourite kind of weather?R: Well, I've always liked sunny weather with scattered clouds for occasional shade. I think that's a nice compromise. Not that we experience much of this in Scotland, of course.M: Do you like the weather in your hometown?R: Well, usually, although there have been times when I wished it had more, I don't know, Mediterranean climate.

I always think something milder is better.M: What do you do in hot weather?R: Well, I think it depends on what I have planned for the day.

But if I had to choose then I'd probably say I prefer it to be too cold because well, at least you can warm yourself up.M: Do you prefer wet or dry weather?R: Well, since I've moved back to Scotland, it's less about what my preferences are and more about what I have to put up with.

What's the weather like is like what kind of weather do you have in your hometown, right? A bit hot. Okay. And you said changeable, so changeable - it often like changes?R: Yeah, so if something's changeable, then it just means that it's, well, it changes fairly regularly. But then that's a part of living next to the sea, isn't it? You can get winds that clear the sky and it's very sunny, or they can bring in a lot of clouds and it becomes very dark and rainy quite quickly. So it's changeable.M: Then you can talk about strong winds. So like really strong winds, or you can say it's windy, it's cloudy. Right? Or you can say we have heat waves, heat waves when it becomes really hot. Yeah, usually in summer, often in Europe, it becomes like +40 degrees. Really hot. So we have heat waves. Here, Rory, you said that. I've always liked sunny weather. So sun. Yeah, it's sunny, sunny weather. What are scattered clouds? Scattered?R: They're just, the clouds are not together. They're apart. So you can see the sky through them, which is good if there's sun behind them, and it's quite a warm day. The opposite to that is overcast. In the same way you have strong winds and the opposite to that is light winds.M: Yeah, if for example, you don't have sunny days, and the clouds use it's cloudy. You can say the sky is overcast, right? So it's cloudy, or the sky is overcast. And occasional shade. So if I'm like not in the sun, but I'm in the shade.R: Well, not in the direct sunlight. Yeah.M: Occasional. Occasional like sometimes, right? So I prefer occasional shade. Not to be in the sun all the time. Climate change. You can talk about climate change. And Rory, what did you say about climate change?R: Well, if climate change keeps going, then we are in for more of that or that's exactly what we're in for. So if you're in for something, it just means it's going to happen in the future.",

But if it's a normal one, like my 33rd, then I don't really go out at all, to be honest. There doesn't seem to be much point.M: What did you do on your birthday when you were young?R: Well, when I was a child, we used to go to these sort of, oh, I don't know what you'd call them, specialist soft play centres. But later on in my teenage years, it was usually just house parties. And that was okay.M: How did you celebrate your last birthday?R: Well, if you mean my 33rd, then I didn't really celebrate it because I was at work. I suppose if we have to talk about any particular gift, it would have been the gift of sleep at the end of it. And I definitely got a lot of that. I did like my cake, though. Specifically the icing on it. It's really the only time you can justify something like that.M: What birthday presents do you like to get?R: Well, I'm pretty low-maintenance.

I don't really like odd or extravagant presents.M: How do children celebrate birthdays in your country?R: Well, if they're young, then I think they have parties at their houses or like the type of venues that I mentioned earlier.

You can say that I enjoy getting books for my birthday, I enjoy getting nice jewellery. On my birthday or for my birthday, Rory, you said you go out with friends. So you didn't say anything just more interesting than going out with friends, really?R: Like really, I have a very boring life when it comes to birthdays. This is why I was relying on the grammar, to be honest with you. And there was some nice grammar because we were focusing on the zero conditional. And there was also used to in there as well. But if you're younger, there are also activities in places to go to. So, we talked about soft play centres.

So if you land on it, then you won't hurt yourself. So that's quite good. If you're a young person, I imagine if you're an adult, it's not very entertaining.

You can say, alright, I enjoy cakes, I blow out candles, I get presents. And Rory, I've prepared a list...R: Of things for me to do on my next birthday?M: Exactly, exactly.R: Come on then.M: So, please also choose an activity for you.

Then I would always take the bus by myself. And, oh, well, that all felt very grown up at the time, even though it was a very short journey to make. The bus routes are not very long, at least where I'm from.M: Do most people prefer public transport?R: Well, if I were to guess I would say no. I think they use it out of necessity more than actually wanting to do it, because even green-minded people would probably admit that private transport is a lot more convenient than public transport.M: What's the most popular means of transport in your hometown?R: Definitely cars. You would see it immediately if you lived here, they line both sides of the street. Thank heavens, there's only about 1000 people here. Otherwise, everything would be packed, and it would be impossible to move.M: Is driving to work popular in your country?R: I would say so. And I would say it with more certainty if I can see the statistics more closely. Certainly, it just seems obvious, since places in my country are so far apart.M: Will you use public transport more in the future?R: Well, if I were to guess I would say probably not. I mean, I like working from home. And well, private transport is much more convenient. And to be honest, with the worsening weather the roads are becoming increasingly unnavigable, so I can see less and less public transport in my future.M: Are there any traffic problems in your area?R: When I think about what it's been like, since I moved, I wouldn't say so, I think the worst-case scenario is if you get stuck behind a tractor or a flock of sheep. But there aren't any major problems like traffic jams, or like majorly congested roads or anything like that.M: How would you improve transport in your town?R: Well, if I were in charge of the local authority, I would definitely have a greater number or vastly improved bus links between the villages because there aren't many right now. And it would make my life more convenient. And if I had an infinite budget, then I'd build a light railway between them as well. But I think that's probably impractical.

Where do you think you're going?R: I think I would just sit there like with my hands up around me like, I don't want to die. Get me out of here.M: Okay, that's fun.

      "M: Do you like social media?R: I suppose if I'd been asked that this time last year, then I would say no, because I really don't, or I really didn't like it. But I've kind of come to appreciate it, with the exception of the kind of \"clickbaity\" content that's quite popular these days.M: Which social media do you often use?R: Well, it's hard to say since however reluctant I am, I'm on it constantly. However, if I didn't have a choice in the matter, I would probably say or I would have said Instagram, because, well, there's just... I have a wider audience on there. And there's greater variety in terms of content.M: Do you think your friends spent too much time on social media?R: Absolutely. They seem glued to their screens now, constantly answering their DMs. If I were there when they were designing these sites, I wouldn't have these issues now, since I'd have removed them all at the time.M: Do you want to work in a social media company?R: Well, I might have a job there now, if I hadn't been such a terrible student in my IT classes, to be honest with you. The concepts of coding and web development are a bit beyond me now, to be honest.M: What's the most popular form of social media in your country?R: There are different forms. I had absolutely no idea and I suppose I'd have been able to give a better answer if I'd had time to research it more, well, in greater depth. However, if we divide it by age group and interest, then Twitter's popular amongst politically minded adults and Instagram is popular for sort of content-obsessed millennials and then Tik Tok is popular amongst self-obsessed zoomers, probably.M: Thank you, Rory, for your positive answers!R: Oh, social media...

Oh, that's true, actually, because the transcripts are linked in the description too. So now, there is no need to contact us directly on Instagram, or send us emails, you can find the links to that in the description as well.M: Social media. Media. So it's plural. So social media are important, right?R: No, social media is important. Well, it's not, it's frivolous and stupid. But it's always social media is.M: What? Is? Wait, wait, wait. I've just opened a Wikipedia page and social media, social media are interactive technologies that facilitate the creation and sharing of information, ideas...R: Well, that's wrong. Social media is a set of interactive technologies. And also, why are you on Wikipedia? Wikipedia is like the worst place to look for information on things.M: Wait, but isn't media plural?R: Well, it can be a plural form. But social media.M: The term social media is both singular and plural in modern English usage.R: Oh, good, in modern English usage when the language is a total disaster area.M: The word media is traditionally a plural because medium is the singular.R: I can just about guarantee you if you say social media are, the examiner is going to be like...",

And that brings everything together nicely in the space of just a few minutes.M: Would you like to learn how to cook?R: Well, I picked up a few recipes from my mom, who did most of the cooking when I was younger, at least most of the cooking in our family when I was younger.

And I can't take any of it in.M: Who usually does the cooking in your family?R: Well, like I said, my mom was the first port of call back in the day when it came to cooking things.

      "M: Do you like going to the hairdressers?R: Well, I'm sort of in two minds about this one, because while it is nice to have a sort of short cut and get all the pampering that goes with hair, I always feel a bit sad afterward because it's so short, and I always think my hair looks really good with a side parting. And when it's been blow-dried into place.M: Do you want to change your hair colour?R: Well, I used to want to dye my hair and I actually did so quite frequently. But now I've come to terms with the fact that I'm a distinguished grey or I'm turning a distinguished grey. So that's not so bad. It could be much worse. I could be going bald, and I'm definitely not. So it's pretty good. It's a good compromise.M: How often do you have a haircut?R: I used to aim for about once a month. Although, to be honest, now after about eight weeks, I always think it's got a pretty decent length and it looks great when I wear it up. It's usually after the eight-week mark that I head off to the barber's and have it cut because it just gets unmanageable after that.M: How long have you had this haircut?R: About three weeks, I suppose. I went to my usual Turkish barber and they cut my hair along with doing everything like trimming my eyebrows, burning off the hair around my ears. And then... Oh yeah, they also decided that they would wax my nose hairs as well and do pore cleansing at the same time. Which sounds horrifying, but actually it's quite a nice refreshing feeling after it's finished.M: Have you had a haircut you didn't like?R: Oh, absolutely, yes. About four years ago, I got this really, really weird haircut. I don't even know what you call it. It was like a sort of fat Mohawk in the middle of my head and the sides were shaved. And that was not a good look. It's like one of the least sensible styles I ever had. And to make it worse, I didn't get my beard trimmed. I had it shaved as well. So it just it wasn't a good look.M: Thank you, Rory, for your answers!R: Hopefully they weren't too hair-raising.",

But could you imagine if you were a bald person, and you went into the exam, and someone asked you these questions, you would be sitting there thinking, what?M: Yeah, a bald person is a person without hair. So he's just bald, like no hair. Yeah, that would be horrible. But I think a bald person used to have some hair, right? Maybe like when they were a child. Maybe like at school? I don't know. So, yeah, some hair stories could be told. Rory, you said that I'm sort of in two minds about it. So I'm in two minds about it.R: Yeah. So it's like there's, I'm a bit, I have positive feelings about it and I have negative feelings about it. Because while I really like having the fresh feeling of a new haircut, I also miss my old hair. And I think when you go to a hairdresser's or a barber's, they make a point of cutting it a little bit shorter than you wanted it, so that you'll grow into it, and it's not like it starts to get too long immediately. So there's that period afterwards where you're thinking, oh my god, this is too short, but maybe that's me. Maybe I just don't know my hair very well.M: You go to the hair dresses to have your hair cut. For example, you can say I had my hair cut last month. So you didn't cut your hair. The stylist cut your hair. And Rory usually has short hair. So you said that I had a short cut.R: Yes. And the same way you could say I got my hair cut as well. So I had and I got for things that were done for you. Oh, is this a grammar focus?M: Oh, yes. Is this really nice grammar structure? I got my hair cut, or I got my hair dyed. Dyed - like change of colours, right? And we say like a haircut or haircuts, right? So can I say I got a new haircut?R: Yes, absolutely.M: Yeah. And also style, hairstyle, right? I decided to change my hairstyle, so I went to the hairdresser's.R: We could do this for a lot of things, actually. So I had my hair cut, I had my hair styled, I, well... This isn't to do with haircuts. This is just something unique to Turkish barber's, I had my nose waxed. If you've never had this experience, then try it out and try not to die of a heart attack when they do it.M: Yeah, ladies, so we usually say I had my nails done, right? I had my face cleaned.R: I thought you're gonna say I had my face done.",

So simple notes for lessons can be handwritten, for example. But a report probably needs a more professional typed-up approach where you're sitting at your computer typing away and putting everything in a logical order and making it presentable.M: Did you like writing things when you were a child?R: Well, ironically, for someone who loves writing now, I absolutely loathed it when I was a child, actually. Unless it was creative writing. I used to love making up all the crazy plots and interesting characters and like sort of weird and wonderful settings. That was good fun. But if it was like writing for spelling practice, then I wasn't such a big fan.M: What do you like to write?R: Well, I really like writing lesson plans for myself if I can do it by hand. I like watching everything come together while I'm sort of jotting down the main stages and making small notes as I think about the students that I'm going to be teaching and adding in things that they like. I also like making entries in my journal as well. It's great to unburden yourself through writing, or at least I find it quite useful.M: Do you think the things you write will change?R: Well, I hope so.

So our Rory produces things at freaking 5:30 In the morning. Oh, my God... You haven't stopped doing this, right? So still 5:30?R: Still 5:30. Although I stay in bed for a little bit longer. So it's like wake up at 530 and then switch on the heating, and then go back to bed and wait for the heat to rise. Then I can function.M: Painful, dear listener, it's a painful morning.R: It's not a painful morning, it's fine. It's just you need to get used to it. That's all. You have to really, really want to do it. And if you don't really want to do it, then do not do it.M: So do you lie in your bed or you lay in your bed/R: I lie in my bed.M: Lie in my bed. Okay? For some time.R: Although in the past, I lay in my bed for some time. Oh, I was gonna say, just looking at it here, I talk about getting more done. And usually, when we talk about getting things done, that's by someone else for us. But when I say I get more done, or I feel like I'm getting more done or in the hopes of getting more done, and we talk about the morning, then we're talking about ourselves doing more things. So it's like you're treating yourself as someone who is working for you. Whoa, grammar for a high score.M: Morning routine. So we develop our morning routine. Or we set our morning routine. And Rory told us like nothing really out of the ordinary.R: Yes. I'd like to think that most people don't do anything out of the ordinary for their morning routine. I mean, this is the time when you usually wake up and become active for the day. And normally that's a very logical process. There's very few people, you know, like one day on Monday I jump out of bed and set myself on fire, on Tuesday I jump into a pit of bats. And then on Wednesday, I wake up and I drink a litre of petrol and then and then I go for a run. Like no, you would have a pretty normal morning routine. Nothing out of the ordinary to start your day and then you begin the unusual things. No?",

But hopefully, I'll have more time after that. And I'll be reading a lot more.M: Are your reading habits now different than before?R: Well, I definitely used to read much more avidly than now. Actually, that's one of the things I miss the most about childhood, having all that time to read. But hopefully, I'll get it back in the future.M: Have you ever read a novel that has been adapted into a film?R: Well, off the top of my head, I can't really think of any. I mean, maybe Harry Potter, but I think everyone's seen that particular adaptation. So that's not very original, is it? Oh, I read Jurassic Park as well, that was adapted into a movie as well.M: Which do you prefer, reading books or watching movies?R: Oh, definitely reading. I love the idea of just switching off and ploughing through a novel in the space of a day or an evening. Although admittedly, it's been a while since that happened. But like I said before, I'm looking forward to having the time to do that again.M: What was your favourite book as a child?R: Oh, that's a good question. I'd have to cast my mind back pretty far, now that I think about it. I think it was actually the Jurassic Park novel that I talked about before. I think that's a pretty unusual thing to read when you're eight or nine years old, but I really enjoyed it. And, well, like I say, it got me hooked on speculative fiction.

      "M: Do you often feel bored?R: Oh, I think my life is about as far from monotonous as you could get really. I mean, I do this podcast, and I teach, which is always entertaining since every day is never the same as the last. So yeah, I definitely don't worry about boredom.M: Do you think school is boring?R: I suppose it depends what you mean. As a teacher, I'd say it's more tiring than boring. As a student, it probably gets a bit humdrum if you're doing the same thing again and again.M: What kinds of things would make you feel bored?R: Well, when people repeat themselves, especially in meetings. It's not great. It really gets on my nerves, actually. I get that maybe people might not pick up on things initially. But if you just repeat the same thing again and again, then it gets pretty tedious after a while, to be honest with you. Or if conversations always have the same theme, like someone who constantly talks about themselves. Although the irony of me saying that on this podcast, where I only talk about myself is probably quite obvious, or it should be.M: What would you do if you felt bored?R: Well, the context is important. If it's a meeting, well, I usually try to lean forward and make it looks like I'm listening, while like, while doodling or taking notes in my notebook. And that usually does a convincing enough job of, well, like I say, convincing people that I'm not bored. If it's at a party, though, I have a very bad habit of saying that I'm bored, just announcing this out loud. Well, that's not happened in a while. But I don't think it's the best way to deal with boredom, to be honest with you.M: Are you more bored now than when you were young?R: I think I was bored more in the past compared to now, to be honest with you. Because, well, first of all, I couldn't do anything about it because I was a child. And when you're a child, you have less freedom of action. And now, there is a wider range of distractions to choose from. And you have the freedom of action to access them, well, now that I'm a grown-up. So I would definitely say that I used to be more bored than I am now. Definitely.M: Have you always found the same things boring?R: Well, I've always found unengaging people in conversations pretty boring, to be honest with you. And I always call them on it as well, because it's not that difficult to hold a conversation or to create interest. You just share something about yourself and create a space for someone to either share something about themselves, or to ask a question. And that's not hard. So I don't understand why boring people subject others to that.M: What do you think will bore you in the future?R: Well, anything connected to technology will always bore me to tears. It just doesn't really appeal to me. And of course, anything that Vanya has to say about me taking my job seriously, because he knows that it's hard for me. I'm sorry, Vanya. I'm not sorry, Vanya.M: Rory, thank you for your answers!R: It's, okay, hopefully, they weren't boring. You said that in a really flat way. Thank you for your answers!M: Not boring at all.R: How rude.",

You might be boring, but you're very pretty and therefore...M: And you're Scottish. And also this adds this little nice touch. It's like a cherry on a nice cake. Boring, cute and Scottish.R: No, it would be boring, but cute and Scottish.M: Nice.R: Maybe I should put that on my profile instead.

So, dear listener, we can feel bored. Right? Or we can feel boredom. Boredom is a noun. To feel bored. So I know a lot about boredom. The feeling of feeling bored. Rory used an adjective. Monotonous. So my life is far from monotonous. Monotonous is...R: Monotonous is just like, it literally means one. It's like Greek or Latin for one tone. So it's like the same thing always, all the time.M: Yeah. And my sound of monotonous is...R: For me that is the sound of irritating.M: Or you can say that my life is far from monotonous. It's quite entertaining. So that's another adjective. Entertaining. It's fun. It's full of red, full of colour, full of a Rory.R: Each day is never the same.M: Yeah, or it's a dull boring. Yeah? We say it's dull boring. It's really dull and boring. School could be boring. And also Rory told us it's more tiring than boring. So if you get tired, something is tiring. Right? Or exhausting. Because Rory is a teacher. Surprise, surprise. He still is working as a teacher.R: At the time we are recording this video, yes, I am a primary school teacher.M: Rory, you did use a good one. It gets a bit humdrum. Humdrum.R: Yes. But humdrum is just the same thing always. Like it's very humdrum. We're just doing the same thing again and again.M: Can I say like sometimes my days get a little bit humdrum?R: You can.",

Or at least it smells pretty good.M: When would you go to a fast food restaurant?R: When I'm totally desperate? No, like, seriously, I'm joking. Actually, I get a burger and fish suppers from the chipper that's just across the street from where I live. And that's usually on a Friday after I finish the gym. I know, it sounds like counterproductive and it's a lot of empty calories, but I think I've earned it after following a rigid diet for the rest of the week.M: Do you think you'll eat more fast food in the future?R: Well, I hope not. Actually, I'd like to start eating less food in general, to be honest with you. But as long as I have the money I'll occasionally indulge and gulp down some junk food every now and then. Why not?",

Fried frog or the bugs, you know, they have...R: I've had frogs and snails before but that's not fast food. That's considered like quite, not nouvelle cuisine. What's the right term? It's considered a delicacy that takes a really long time to prepare, at least in my opinion.M: Okay.R: Fast food. Weird fast food. I can't think of any. I think maybe the closest thing was, we had... In East Timor, they had like noodle soup that they would serve on these carts to people. And that was quite good, because first of all, it was fast. And second of all, it was healthy. Which is unusual for fast food. But apart from that, no, I can't think of anything terribly interesting. What about you?M: Yeah, I don't think I can... Oh, maybe in Turkey. In Turkey, they have this fast food. It's called like, I might be wrong about the name. Sorry, Turkish people. Kokoreç. Kokoreç is this thing, the meat and it can come in with a surprise. So it's a bit disgusting. So let's not go into detail.R: Okay, well...M: But it's yummy. It's really good.R: Oh, there was a thing I saw on Instagram. This is, since we're talking about different countries. There was this thing in Iran. It's like crispy rice. I don't know if it's fast food or not, but it looked really good as well. Anyway, we're getting a bit sidetracked because we need to talk about the fast food.M: Bland food. Bland food doesn't have any taste. It's just not spiced. It's just bland, like tasteless. Yeah?R: Yes.M: And usually we can say that fast food has empty calories. So you just eat and there are no nutrients. It's not, you know, healthy.R: Yeah, it's just pure energy going into your system. And it doesn't really matter what the nutrient combinations are.M: And these empty calories do the job in a pinch. In a pinch. And this is an idiomatic expression.R: It is, yes.

Oh, yeah, bizarrely enough, the development of Scottish agriculture. That was not very interesting. Oh, and we did the 19th century, or, like it was Victorian policy developments, which sounds boring. But it was actually really cool. It was all about the different social movements and sort of laws that were made at the time to expand the franchise. That was cool.M: Did you enjoy studying history at school?R: Well, I absolutely loved it. Apart from the agriculture stuff that was like really obscure and totally random in, like, it was a really weird thing to study in a Scottish school. I think the one I liked the most was studying German nationalism. That was particularly interesting, because it read like some sort of historical epic. And then there were all these revolutions and battles that were involved in it. And also, there were things that were connected to the suffragettes and the extension of the franchise, when we looked at 19th-century Britain.

So it's interesting and good for me that other people have picked up this banner and put their own spin on it and added these videos to YouTube so that I can listen to them.M: What period in history would you like to learn more about?R: I'd have to think about that for a moment. Oh, I quite liked reading about the American Civil War. But I don't know much about the antebellum and postbellum period. So that would be interesting to read up on.M: Do you think you will learn more about history in the future?R: Well, I hope so. Because I've just had that realization that I need to read more about the American past. So I definitely know what my start point will be.M: Where do you go to learn about history where you live?R: Well, there's the local library across the road from where I live. And there are various cultural and heritage centres with everything that's attached to them. And there's also lots of older people wandering around who might like to share their time and knowledge if they, if they want to.

Meaning like the time in the past. Maybe about the Roman Empire, about, Rory mentioned the 19th century. So Victorian Age. Yeah? And you said like, bizarrely enough, we talked about Scottish agriculture. So what is this strange word bizarre? Bizarrely?R: Bizarre, just means strange. And then bizarrely enough, is like emphasizing the strangeness. Because, of course, you have like, wars and social movements. And then it's like agriculture. So really, like niche thing to study when you're in high school. I don't know why we did that. And I would love to know what the idea behind that was.M: Yeah, that's bizarre. Meaning that strange. And like, an adverb is bizarrely enough, right? So bizarre - bizarrely. Like quick - quickly. Right? So bizarrely.R: Bless you.M: Whoa, I'm allergic to history. So guess what?R: What?M: I have two books here. Encyclopedia. They're... History, historical, encyclopedia.R: For kids. It says \"для детей\".M: Yeah. For kids. Oh, look at your Russian. Wow.R: Look at me. I can read.M: Yeah, for kids. This is for kids. You know, this doorstopper is for kids. Oh my gosh.R: That is the most Russian thing ever. It's like this is for children, you could hit them over the head and kill someone with it.M: And tell me do we call it a historical encyclopedia or a historic?R: Historical encyclopedia. Because historic is... It's used to describe major events. For example, like a historic victory or a historic event. Those things, it's like something will last and be recorded as a significant thing in history. So we have to be careful with that kind of thing.M: Yeah. When we talk about places, so do we call them historic places or historical?R: I would call them historical places. Yeah. Unless maybe it's a very significant place. In which case, you could say like, this is the site of the historic battle between two sides.M: You can say that I absolutely loved history at school, or I hated it.R: Say you loved history at school.

I had no idea. And, well, now that you've put me on the spot, probably milk chocolates. If I'm having a moment where I don't care about my health.

But it's still, in hindsight it wasn't a great idea or a great lifestyle choice at the time.M: Is it good to give chocolate as gifts to others?R: Well, I don't see why not, unless they're, well, assuming they're not diabetic or lactose intolerant. Because chocolate's like it's cheap, it's available, it exists in a variety of flavours and forms. So it would definitely be at the top of my list of ideas as a gift for somebody.M: Why do you think chocolate is popular around the world?R: Well, it's funny, actually, because I was thinking about it there after that question about whether I liked eating chocolate. And I wondered, is it because of the sugar that's in it? And I think that might actually be what attracts people to it, rather than the, or at least its combination with the chocolate flavour. Although I imagine there are some chocolate connoisseurs out there who would talk about the texture of the chocolate and the different histories that draw people in. But I would probably go back to my original answer and say that it's the sugar that's really getting people hooked on it.",
    discussion:
      "M: Yum, yum, yum. How yummy was that, dear listener? So Chocolate. Chocolate is countable or uncountable? So chocolate is good. Chocolate is expensive. There is lots of chocolate, right?R: But you can also have chocolates, like individual chocolates in a box. I mean, for example... We came prepared for this episode.M: Ooh...R: I have a box of chocolates.M: Yum, yum, yum.R: From one of my pupils that I teach. So thank you very much! This is coming in extremely handy. So it's made from chocolate, uncountable, but there are chocolates in it. And we were talking about flavours of chocolate and these are actually mint chocolate. Cool mint chocolate.M: Yeah, so a box of chocolates. And chocolates as individual like little things. Okay? And Rory told us that he likes sensations that come with eating chocolate. Sensations that what you feel. Sensations, like...M: You have your taste buds, so taste buds that kind of feel the taste... And then, like the sensations which come with eating chocolate, but the aftermath. Aftermath. Math, math.R: Yes. The aftermath.M: Of eating chocolate is not really good.R: It's not great.M: Yeah. Because of a lot of sugar. Right? You said. And yeah, we can say that chocolate is this forbidden food.R: Is it?M: Well, like some people say it's like forbidden and we shouldn't eat chocolate because it makes people overweight. It has a lot of sugar. But I reckon that chocolate is good for us, chocolate is happiness. Dear listener, do you agree?R: Yeah. Well, chocolate releases endorphins, doesn't it? So that's one of the sensations that you can get when you eat it. And probably it's not really the chocolate that's the problem. It's the people eating too much of it. Put down the chocolate and step away from the cake and you'll be fine.M: If you eat chocolate in moderation.R: Yes.M: In moderation like in, you know, like, not like that...R: Yeah, like a healthy, a healthy medium, a healthy balance.",

    conversation:
      "M: Do you like wearing jewellery? What types?R: Well, I used to like wearing it. I had a religious chain and this beaded bracelet. And, oh, I had a gold engagement ring as well on my finger. But I don't wear them now because I was terrified of misplacing them. So I got them tattooed on my ribs instead, to ensure that I didn't do this.M: How often do you wear jewellery?R: Almost never these days, unless it's to make a statement or it's a very special occasion. Like I said, I don't wear them now because I was living in fear of losing or misplacing them or even them getting stolen. Regardless of how unlikely that is. I was just trying to make sure it didn't happen 100%.M: Do you wear a lot of jewellery?R: I'm running out of ways to say no, because I'm scared it'll go astray. I usually travel quite light. So if I'm just sort of festooned in jewellery, then it's just a lot of extra faff. And I don't really need that, when I'm out and about, well, even when I'm out and about, I should say, not just when I'm travelling from country to country.M: Do you usually buy jewellery?R: For my mom? Yeah. By contrast to me, she's really into earrings and necklaces and bracelets and everything else that falls under the umbrella of jewellery. I don't think I've bought it for anyone else. But that's probably because all of my ideas get absorbed by the effort of thinking of gifts for my mum. Also, hi, mum! I'm on the internet.M: Why do some people wear a piece of jewellery for a long time?R: Well, I imagine for some sentimental or cultural reasons. I mean, for example, I used to wear my grandmother's engagement ring on my finger for good luck. But most people wear engagement rings for cultural reasons like showing that they're not on the dating market or on the dating scene. The same thing goes for wedding rings actually.M: Have you ever given jewellery as a gift?R: These questions are not terribly original, are they? As I said before I buy jewellery as a birthday or a Christmas present for my mum or maybe I'll see something in a store when I'm out randomly that I think she'll quite like. I don't often go perusing market stalls these days actually. So usually it's perfume or something like that. But if I'm going to buy it as a gift, then it'll be my previous answer I'll need to refer you to.M: Thank you, Rory, for your answers!R: Hooray!",
    discussion:
      "M: Jewellery! Check out my rings. Do you like my rings?R: Yes, I like the rings. Where did you get them? You've got one on each finger and thumb, right?M: Yeah.R: Okay, so there's a story behind each one of these. So tell us what they are.M: Oh, there is a story behind each ring. Oh, so this one is from Peru. This one is with diamonds. Not from diamonds but with diamonds. Okay? Golden diamonds. Diamonds are whose best friends?R: Well, diamonds are a girl's best friend. But diamonds are also forever. Apparently.M: Yes. This one is from Venice. Venetian glass. Ooh...R: What's Venetian glass? And how is that different to regular glass?M: No, it's some special kind of glass that they produce only in Venice on this one island. I don't remember the name of it.R: Somewhere in Venice. If you're Italian, let us know.M: Yeah, so this is like a handmade. Rory, do you think that jewellery has a story? So every jewellery piece, jewellery or jewellery piece has a story.R: I don't know if every piece does because you get some stuff that's mass-produced. All of the stuff that I've worn has been one of a kind. But if you're going to wear it, then it probably should have a story. Because what is the point of jewellery? It's like an attractive adornment on a human being and it's designed to provoke conversation of interest. So surely there should be a story to go with it. And not just because.M: One of a kind means it's not mass produced, like for everybody, but it's only like unique, it's only one piece. Like this handmade ring, you won't find the same ring anywhere, right? So I prefer jewellery. What do we say? I prefer one-of-a-kind jewellery pieces?R: Well, you can't prefer it really. Because if it's one of a kind, then you either have it or you don't. I suppose it's fair to say like all of my jewellery is one of a kind. Or all of my pieces of jewellery are one of a kind.M: Yes and jewellery is uncountable. So jewellery is. And it's expensive. Okay? So like... Jewellery. It's expensive. And jewellery, there is lots of jewellery. And jewellery is it. Not they. Okay? Yeah. Or jewellery pieces. You can say jewellery pieces are one of a kind. I prefer gold and diamonds.R: Nothing too expensive or extravagant then.M: No, no, just like mass market, just like diamonds.",

      "M: Do you enjoy looking at the stars?R: When I get the chance I do. And it's not just the stars either. It's the planets and the nebulae. I used to love, and I still do, sitting on the decking at three o'clock in the morning on a Saturday just watching them for ages.M: Have you ever learned about outer space and stars?R: Well, we had a few inputs in school, but most of what I know about, well, celestial events and heavenly bodies I've read or watched for myself. I don't think primary or even secondary school children probably need to learn that much about coronal mass ejection or star formation. So it's really something that you have to pursue for yourself outside of the basics, like, you know, what the order of the planets is in the solar system, for example.M: Are you interested in films about outer space and stars?R: Oh, absolutely. I love hard and soft science fiction. So anything about extraterrestrials, and space travel is right up my avenue. I really like the plots of films like \"Arrival\" and \"Contact\". But I also like the mindless fun of \"Starship Troopers\" as well.M: Can you see many stars at night where you live?R: Well, the light pollution here is quite low. So you don't just see stars and constellations, you can see planets like Mars. And if you move further out to the village where there's almost no people, then you can even see things like the Orion Nebula, for example. I can't think of anything else that you could see, but they're all up there twinkling away. So that's great.M: Would you ever like to go into space?R: Well, with the current level of technology, probably not. I mean, if we had a space elevator or a skyhook, for example, to make it safer, then I would absolutely be down for that. But I'm not strapping myself to the top of a rocket filled with fuel and setting it on fire to get there. That's just, it just seems really dangerous.M: What would you do if you had the chance to go into space?R: Well, it would be cool to see the Earth from orbit and just see what everything looks like. I'd also really like to do a spacewalk. Just for the novelty in the risk that's involved, to be honest. I doubt I'd make the astronaut fitness requirements though.",

      "M: Houston, Houston, did he use all gorgeous vocabulary? Uh-huh. What about grammar? Ah-ha. The second conditional? Okay. Okay. So, look at the stars, Rory used to gaze at the stars or star gazing. I enjoy star gazing. Like I enjoy looking at the star. Rory, are you a stargazer?R: I'm an opportunistic stargazer. So whenever the opportunity presents itself, then I will do that, but I'm not an amateur or a professional astronomer with the telescope.M: So if you enjoy looking at the stars, you can say oh, I enjoy going out to stargaze. So to stargaze, I enjoy star gazing. I'm not a stargazer. Gazer like, I'm like looking at the stars. Rory did use a very specific word about this, you know, a cloud of gas and dust in space. What, what was it?R: Oh, the nebula. Yeah, well, nebulae, nebula. They're... Oh, everybody thinks they're giant clouds of gas. But it's not just that. It's their collections of material that are spread out across a really large area of space. It's easy to say that they're just gas, but it's not that simple. There are things inside nebula for example, but people think oh, it's like a cloud. There shouldn't be anything solid inside of it. But there are.M: You can also say I enjoy looking at myriads of stars. Myriads like lots of stars. Like countless. You can't count them. Countless stars. And Nebula. Nebula like is this one and is plural, right? So if we talk about many lots you say...R: Nebulae.M: You said that you had some inputs at school about space and stars. So inputs, obviously lessons.R: Yeah.M: But a good one. Yeah? Like input sessions, like they put stuff in you, right? Or maybe just they want to put stuff in you, but it doesn't stay in or it doesn't go in. It's just, you know. Yeah. So inputs at school about stars and space. And also which events? Celestial?R: Yes. So like, well, celestial events or celestial bodies. It really doesn't matter. But they're things that happen in space. So if we talk about celestial, then it's something happening in outer space. Beyond the Earth.M: The moon is a celestial body.R: Yes, a heavenly body.M: And then you can say that, oh yes, I did study astronomy at school, or I had some input on stars and space. And also I remember something about coronal mass ejections, and star formations.R: That's not from school. That's just something I read about or watched videos about. So a coronal mass ejection is just... It's like... Oh, God, if you're an astronomer, please don't get angry with me. But it's when a lot of hot stuff comes out of the sun and is fired into space. That's what it is.M: A lot of hot stuff? Hot stuff. Oh, it's hotR: Plasma.M: Plasma? Okay.",

Because, well, first of all, our YouTube channel is amazing. And second of all, it's the only way that you'll get to see this in, well, kind of costume change ever because I'm never doing this again. I don't know how Maria does it for every single episode, but I'm not.M: Okay. So we should talk about different types of T-shirts. Rory mentioned a... What, like V-neck shirts or V-neck T-shirts. Like victory. And you can say that I'm a big fan of V-neck T-shirts, or I'm not a big fan of V neck T-shirts. And also, dear listener, if you're listening to this, you should google different types of T-shirts that we're mentioning. Okay? Or you can watch our video on YouTube to make sure you know what different shirts mean. Okay? So you should see the pictures of them.R: Or if you go on our YouTube channel, you will see me holding up the different shirts to the video camera.M: So, V-neck T-shirt. Go ahead. A V-neck.R: I don't own any V-neck shirts because I don't like the look of them. But V neck would be like a V shape here and it's open. But I find that to be, I don't know, I think they look noxious. I can't think of another word to describe them.M: I like V-neck T-shirts. So what about polo-neck T-shirts?R: I have a polo-neck T-shirt. Hold on.M: Come on. Come on. We want to see.R: This is my polo-neck T-shirt. I have two of them. Polo-neck, it's when it's got buttons here at the front, and you can button them down. So it's like a V-neck, but you can control how much of your chest you're showing, which, if you're me is rather important because I like to stay modest. And I do like a good polo neck.M: Rory doesn't like singlets. Singlets or they're also called half T-shirts.R: Well, I think they look like a vest, and I wear vests to sleep. But I'm not going to wear one, when I'm outside. I think that's just showing off, isn't it? Like maybe you might wear it if you were like really, really muscley, for example, but I am not. So I'm not going to wear one.M: So you can say that I enjoy long sleeves T-shirts or short sleeves.R: It's important to point out they have short sleeves or long sleeves, but they are short-sleeved or long-sleeved.M: How many T-shirts does Rory own?R: More than six.M: Oh, more than six?

      "M: Do you always bring many keys with you?R: Well, to be honest, the only keys I carry are my front door key and my garage key, since those are the only things in my home that have locks on them. So that's all I need.M: What are the different types of keys you have? And how do they differ?R: Like I said, I've got a front door key and a garage key. Although why I have two different keys for those, I don't know, because they're located right next to each other. So that's a bit weird. And they're also roughly the same size as well. I used to have the key to my old apartment in Timor as a keepsake. And that was much smaller because it was a padlock key, but I was afraid I would lose it. So I had it tattooed on me. And I think that's about it in terms of the keys that I have now anyway.M: Have you ever copied a key?R: I can't remember the last time I was in a locksmith, to be honest with you. I think I had keys cut from my work about 10 years ago. But that's it. Sorry.M: Have you ever used a keyless entry system?R: Well, we used to have a keypad on the door of my old apartment in Moscow. Although, you needed this fob thing. And that's sort of like a key, isn't it? So sort of yes and no.M: How do you keep your keys secure?R: Well, if I told you that they wouldn't be very secure now, would they? To be honest, I just keep them in... Well, I keep them on a loop in my back pocket. I don't even have a keychain, to be honest. That's not very secure, is it?M: What's the oldest key you have in your possession?R: I think it will be the one that I mentioned before, which I kept from Timor. It's about 10 years old, actually. It's a padlock key as well. I think I mentioned that. And I think I still have the padlock, now that I think about it. I'll need to dig it out sometime and show people.M: Have you ever lost a key and had to replace it?R: I think I dropped my keys when I was in high school. But it was only the one time and that's all I can think about, to be honest. And after that I was locked out of my house. I actually think we had to get the locks changed after that, to be honest. Oops.M: Is it a good idea to leave your key with a neighbour?R: Well, in my case, it might be and it might not be because my neighbour is my landlady. So this property actually belongs to her. And I think she would have the keys already, to be honest. But even if she doesn't, then she's very trustworthy. So it would not be a bad idea for sure.M: How can you avoid losing your keys?R: Well, I used to keep mine on a keychain. But I don't really do that anymore, because I actually ironically lost my keychain. But I always keep them in the same place. They're always in my back pocket or sitting on my desk and they can only be in those two places. That's all really. I have a friend who keeps his keys in the bowl, but he's got hundreds of them. So that doesn't really apply to me.M: Do you always take your keys when you go out?R: I'm going to regret saying this. But no, I don't. I have a shop next door to me. So if I'm just going to the shop very quickly, I don't take my keys with me and I just leave the door open. So I probably just invited a whole load of people to come and rob my house there. But if I'm just nipping to the shops quickly then there's no point, is there?",

What do you need that for?M: Yeah, my house, my house and the entrance door to my house. So two houses.R: Wait, what? Okay, so you've got two keys for two houses? That makes sense.M: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And one key for the entrance.R: Oh, hold up the black thing you've got. That's a what I would call a fob. Which is like a kind of, at least I call it a fob. I don't know what other people would call it. It's like a, it's a, I don't know, an electronic key, I guess?M: It's a magnetic key.R: Hey, there we go. Yeah.M: Yeah, it's a magnetic key. So you just go like... And it opens up, you know? Right. And, dear listener, you can talk about different kinds of keys. So I use a card key or a key card.

      "M: Are there many small businesses in your area?R: Well, it's a village. So everything we have here is a small family-owned business. I think the only exceptions are the co-op, the distillery up the road and the factory down the road.M: Do you prefer shopping in big companies or in small shops?R: Honestly, I don't have a preference. I mean, whatever is readily available works for me. I mean, on the one hand, big companies tend to have more discounts. I mean you can bulk-buy there. But smaller companies are better for the local economy. So there's, there's positives and negatives to both.M: Why do some people prefer to shop in small businesses?R: Well, it's similar to what I said, I imagine perhaps they like supporting the local economy and large companies can be somewhat predatory in their business practices. It might also be the only choice they have. I mean, if you live in a small rural community, then all you might have is your local shop that's owned by one of the families there.M: Would you ever like to run your own small business?R: I already do. I run this podcast with three of my colleagues and I teach English privately online. And frankly, I'd rather do that than work for some large institution. It gives me greater flexibility and it fits in with my belief in localism and, well, like I said, being flexible.M: When was the last time you bought something from a small business?R: Oh, that's a good question, actually. I'd have to think about it for a bit. I think probably the other day, I actually picked up some food from the local butcher's here. They're actually pretty good. They've won lots of awards for their work. Even though it's a small company. I think it only has like three or four people working there.",

      "M: You know, Rory, I keep trying to start my own hot air balloon business. But it just doesn't take off.R: Take off is a phrasal verb.

But that was.M: To start my own hot air balloon business. Hot air balloon is like this balloon, this big balloon that goes there. But it just doesn't take off. Take off like a plane.R: And take off like to be successful.M: Yeah, it doesn't take off. It's not successful. It's a joke. I know it's horrible, it's horrible. But actually, this is not that bad. Small businesses. So what is a small business? Can we have a definition? Like a small business, how many people and what is it?R: Oh my God, now that you've asked me to define it, there are actually legal definitions of small businesses. Now, if memory serves, a small business is a company that's got zero to 50 people. Medium size is 50 to 100 and large is with 100 or more. Let me just double-check that to make sure. According to Wikipedia, small businesses are types of corporations, partnerships, which have fewer employees, and less annual revenue, like money every year than a regular-sized business or corporation. So kind of a small business is a business that earns not so much money as Google or Apple and has fewer employees.R: And according to the government of the United Kingdom, a small business has an annual turnover of less than 50 million euros and employs fewer than 250 people. Did I say less than 50 people before? Oh... Oh, wow. I'm in trouble with the grammar police.M: Rory, you're an educated native speaker. An educated.R: I got carried away. I studied business management. And one of these things was like legally defining a small business. I'm pretty sure it's fewer than 50 people. I said less than, it should be fewer than. Sorry. And it's a typical slip. A slip is kind of like, not a mistake, but a slip of the tongue. And less people, normally people say less people, less students, but grammatically, it's not correct. And in IELTS, to be on the safe side, yeah, like fewer people, fewer books. But fewer is difficult to pronounce. So it's much easier to say less people. And people out there, just say less people, which is grammatically incorrect.R: Is fewer difficult to pronounce?M: Fewer. But what's easy to say less people, fewer people?R: You're just making it difficult for yourself to make everyone say less rather than fewer.M: No, no, no, but like look, look, look, but when you pronounce the sound, it's like few, few, few. You have to make this few, but less people, less people, less books.",

      "M: Do you live in a noisy area?R: Well, not really. I mean, we occasionally get trucks rumbling through the high street, and the neighbour's dogs bark occasionally. I think that's about the sum of it. We used to have planes screaming over the house. But, well, that doesn't happen so much these days.M: Does being in a noisy place bother you?R: Well, not really. Unless there's like music blaring and I can't even hear myself think, let alone have a conversation. I like to think I've got a pretty high tolerance for noise actually.M: What do you do to escape noisy places?R: Leave? I mean, sorry, honestly. I can't think of anything else. It's not like you can carry soundproofing around with you. Is it?M: Are there any specific noises that annoy you?R: I don't like screaming or any sort of persistent high-pitched noise. But I don't think that's unique to me, to be honest with you.M: What noise do we have in cities?R: Well, I already mentioned air and ground traffic. And I suppose you can hear people going about their business and chattering away. And I imagine you can sometimes hear sirens in the distance because there'll be more emergencies. I couldn't say any more, really, it's been a while since I've lived in a city.M: What kind of noise do cars make?R: Well, they make that sound when you turn the ignition. I think it's called the sound of the engine turning over. And then you can hear people's horns blaring. And you can rev your car. So that's like when you're gaining speed. You can gun the engine and the engine can backfire which some people think sounds like a gunshot. And then, of course, there's a sound of the air like rushing over the car when you have the windows down. So there's lots of noise that can be created by cars.M: What natural sounds do you like?R: Well, sounds that help you unwind or relax and decompress from a long day are quite nice. So things like whale song. And then, well, I suppose dolphin song by association. And it's quite nice as well, when you can see them as well, when you hear dogs barking and they're playing with each other. That's quite relaxing when they work in conjunction with each other. Oh, yeah, and waking up in the morning to bird song. That's great. We have a whole... I think, I guess it's a murder of crows that lives in the town where I live right now in the village. And every morning at like Sunrise, so roughly half past seven in the morning, you just hear all of these birds getting up and flying around and making all of this noise. And you would think that it would be quite disturbing but it's not actually. It's quite a pleasant wake-up call.",

It's a small village. It's only 1000 people but it's not the middle of nowhere. It's kind of the middle of nowhere.M: So first of all noise. We make noise or noise could be created by somebody or something. So noise created by cars, for example. Also, what adjectives can we use with noise? We can say awful, horrible noise. We can say loud or deafening noise.R: Blaring.M: Blaring. What is it? Blaring noise.R: It's just like loud and extended sound. It's like a horn, for example, or... Well, I think that's the best example, to be honest with you. But you can also have collocations to describe it as well. Like making a racket.M: A racket like a racket? Ping pong racket?R: Well, you use a bat for ping pong, don't you?M: Oh, okay. Squash racket.R: Okay, well, the spelling is the same. I guess. Racket.M: So racket is a kind of a noise. Make a racket, make some noise, right?R: Yes. A horrible noise. It's like all noises together. Like a chaos of noise.M: You said that trucks rumbling. So I hear the trucks rumbling. I hear cats meowing. I hear birds singing. I hear trucks rumbling. Rumble is this kind of like what? Like a truck. Imagine a truck, like a huge car and it like rumbles. Also planes. What do planes do?R: Well, they scream or roar overhead. I suppose.M: Planes scream? Really? Like people?R: Well, yeah, like the scream of a plane engine. Yeah, it's quite loud.",

      "M: What things made you happy when you were a child?R: Well, spending time with my family and friends, we used to make up these ridiculous games and scenarios to act out. Oh, I also used to get a kick out of playing on video games consoles as well, when I was younger.M: What activities make you feel happy now?R: Well, anything that makes me feel successful. So you know, doing exercise or completing all of my jobs for the day. Oh, and, well, seeing my friends. I also quite like getting nice messages on social media. It's a nice little dopamine hit. Although I wouldn't do it all the time, of course.M: What kinds of people make you happy?R: Well, I get a lot of enjoyment out of being with people that I'm on the same wavelength as. So, well, like the kind of people that you can just be yourself around. So in my case, that's, you know, cracking dark jokes, and having fun with my friends. That gets the endorphins going.M: When during the day, do you feel happiest?R: Yeah, in the mornings, when I've done my workout and all my little chores for the day, I just feel ready to go. Especially after a good night's rest.M: Does food make you happy?R: If it's nice food that I like, then yes. I doubt I'd be very happy if I were ordering bananas and raisins all the time. And I suppose I like ordering McDonald's and other kinds of fast food from time to time. Again, not all the time. I think I feel my happiest when I have really healthy food because you feel the energy coming. And you know that you're fueling your body with the right stuff for the day. So that's probably a more sustainable kind of happiness, in my case.M: What do you do to stay happy?R: Well, I read a lot, and then I exercise regularly and I have a job and friends that I love. You know, it's, I couldn't ask for anything more, really. It's like my own personal nirvana right now.M: What would make you happy in the future?R: I have no idea, actually. I think it was William Shakespeare that said the future is like the great undiscovered country. So that's why I don't really have a clue. If I'm pushed, then I like to think it will be continued success and, well, opportunities to be around the people that I like and do the things I love. That should do the trick quite nicely.M: When do you feel happy at work?R: I think when I get into that flow state, where everything's coming together, and you sort of time or the feeling or experience of time falls away, and you're really into what you're doing. And all the people around you are doing the same thing as well. I also quite like being in a workspace where I feel connected to the people I'm with. And we have a shared sense of humour. It almost feels like home in that sense. So I get a lot of happiness out of that.M: Do you feel happy when you buy new things?R: Everybody likes a little bit of retail therapy, don't they? although admittedly, in my case, and probably the case of many other people it's like a temporary high, but it's still nice when you buy things that you've wanted for a long time with money that you've worked hard to get.

So I'll go there maybe once or twice a month. I think that's quite often.M: Did you go to a library when you were a child?R: I vividly remember we would go there with our childminder. I used to pick up a load of books on complex topics, just because I liked the pictures. It must be where I get the vocabulary from.M: What do you usually do in the library?R: I like to poke around the lifestyle and science fiction sections in the hopes of finding something interesting. And I've looked up information on local authors for various projects. The librarians there are actually quite helpful if we talk about my library where I live now.M: What kind of people go to libraries to work or study?R: Based on a limited number of visits I've made recently, it's hard to pin down exactly who goes there. I suppose, my best guess would be the, there are people who are interested in finding out about different subjects connected to what they work with or what they study.M: Are libraries popular in your country?R: R: Well, I'm hardly an expert, but if I were to guess, I'd say they're probably relatively more popular now than they used to be in the recent past. Because people are trying to save money by taking books out on loan, rather than by buying them. Just because we have this cost of living crisis. However, I don't think that they're as popular as they were back in the day, like if we're talking like in the 1950s and 60s. Just because people still have more money than they did back then, but still, they're using various cost-cutting measures and so libraries will play a part in that.",

Go to a library, go to the library, go to library?R: Well, go to the library or go to a library, not go to library. You need an article, but go to a library for like one of many and go to the library for a specific one of many. That's usually your local libraries, the library.M: Yeah, and you've mentioned this local library. I usually go to my local library. So local in your neighbourhood, right? Like, your local school, your local shop, your local library, right? In the neighbourhood. So I usually go to my local library or to the local library, right? Or I've never been to a library, a library, yeah? Or I don't like libraries. So, you said that \"up my neck of the woods\"...R: Yes, it's an idiom and a spoiler alert, we are working on an idioms course right now. More information on that further on down the line, which is also an idiom. However, up my neck of the woods means where in the area where I live, not that you live in a forest, it just means where you live.M: Okay, could you give us an example?R: Oh, well, yeah, sure. There aren't many people up my neck of the woods, because it's a village.M: As a child, Rory went to the library and he said that we would go there. So, I would go there. Why would? Because it was a regular action in the past. Okay? So Rory is talking about the past, when he was a child, \"I would go to a library\". Yeah? So kind of, it was a regular action every week. And you can say I went there, or I would go there.R: Yes. I went there, I would go there, I used to go there.M: Who is a childminder?R: A childminder is just someone who looks after you when your parents are unavailable to do that. So... And it's their job to do that. So, a nanny is another word, we just call it a childminder. Like mind means obviously your head and what's going on in there. But, mind can also mean to look after and a minder is someone who looks after something. So a childminder is someone who looks after children. Like, mind the gap, like keep the gap in mind. Yes, it's all connected.M: Pick up a load of books. When you take books from a library, you pick up books, a load of books, lots of books. So, as a child, Rory used to pick up a load of books on complex subjects.R: When we talk about what a book is about, it's a book on something, like I'm reading a book on being creative in schools.",

      "M: Did you go to a good school?R: Well, I certainly like to think so. I mean, I'm not sure where it ranked on the league tables, but the teachers were certainly competent and seemed to enjoy their jobs most of the time. So I would say that's part of being in a good school.M: Where did you go to school?R: I went to a few schools, actually. There were two primary schools and they were just up the road from where I lived. Like literally up the road, you would walk up the road and you would be there. And the high school, which was along the streets and then again up the road. So those were the three schools that I went to.M: Did you like your teachers?R: Not really, no. I only liked one. I liked Mrs Jones in primary four. Hi, Mrs Jones, if you're listening. We had a great working relationship. Well, I think I had a great working relationship with her. I imagine that she probably thought I was quite a handful, but with regards to the other teachers, no, I didn't really like them at all. And we didn't get along very well. Not because they were evil, just because I was a pretty unsettled child and they had a great deal of difficulty understanding me or relating to me. But, you know, I was in a class with 30 other pupils, so it's easy to understand why that might not work on a 1 to 1 basis.M: Was there anything you wanted to change about your school?R: Well, ideally, I'd have had more time to play and be creative. Well, it's hard to say how that would have turned out, actually. But regardless, things seem to have turned out reasonably well in life. But if I could go back and change things, then I think those would be the two things that I would change.M: What were the differences between your school and other schools?R: Well, it's hard to say, really, because you only have the perspective of yourself in your school, which is a pretty isolated context. I don't know what other schools were like, but I would probably say that my schools were a bit impersonal, sort of like factories of conformity and mediocrity, really. Again, not because they're run by horrible people, just because that's the system that you have when you have mass education.M: Thank you, Rory, for your answers!",

If a film is mediocre, it's kind of, the film is okay.R: Yeah. I mean, I would like to point out that all of this is just my perspective. I didn't like school, I hated school. I was one of those kids and then I became a teacher. How ironic... But, you know, I imagine if you're a kid that fits in and is quite settled and even-keeled, then you would have a great time. And a lot of the kids that I went to school with probably did, but I did not. Sorry, I would love to be normal as a child, but if I had been normal then I probably wouldn't be doing this. So it's... That's the trade-off.M: First of all, we say go to school. Can we say study in a school?R: I studied at school. Studied in a school...M: But that's also some... Kind of weird, because we usually say like, oh, I went to school, I went to university. We don't say I studied at school...R: Apchu! Excuse me...M: Bless you, bless you.R: Thank you! Well, I think for colleges and universities, and particularly in American English, they say I study at X, Y, and Z school, but it's not so common in British English. I haven't heard people say that very often.M: I went to a good school or I went to school. Yeah? So no article. Rory told us \"I'm not sure where my school ranked on the league table\". This \"the league table\" is like top schools. And this is like a table, top one is this school. So Rory was not sure about the ranking of his school.R: I mean, it did the job and it was in a reasonably nice middle-class area. So I'm assuming that it was okay.M: The teachers were competent. So that's a nice adjective to use about teachers. The teachers were competent, so they were professional, they knew their subjects. And do you say, school students or pupils?R: Oh, this is a fun one, because I got in trouble for this all the time in my last job, because I would refer to... Like to pupils as students. And apparently, that's not acceptable.M: Ooh.R: So apparently, in the eyes of the people I used to work with, students is an American thing and pupils is a British thing.",

What do I do? Oh, yeah, I have people around. And then I spend Sunday clearing up. And then, well, half of the day clearing up and the other half in bed. Usually, it's the first half in bed. Although, I am trying to get out and about a bit more at weekends now too, that I have all of this free time on my hand.M: What did you do last weekend?R: I've just talked about having fun on the weekends, but actually I was tidying up on Friday. But the reason I was tidying up was because I had a friend over on Saturday for... Oh gosh, what were we doing? Oh, we were walking and drinking and watching movies. And then on Sunday, I was getting ready for the week ahead.M: Do you have plans for your weekends?R: Well, I often try to catch up on sleep and TV shows that I watch. Ooh, on the subject of catching up, I catch up with my friends via video calls. Oh, and while I am trying to get out and about more, like I said, I like playing video games and reading as well.M: What would you never do on the weekend?R: Well, it's hard to say, since I've done just about everything that you would care to name on weekends. I'm trying my best not to work on weekends. And these days I always have nights in as opposed to nights out because, well, staying in is cheaper and more intimate than going out. Sorry, I'm a cheapskate.",
    discussion:
      "M: So, dear listener, the weekend. We say on the weekend, at the weekend? Rory, what's the deal with the weekends?R: Well, what... On the weekend and at the weekend. Both are fine. I think at the weekend is more common in British English and on the weekend is American English, if I'm correct. But you can say both.M: Yeah, and do I need an article? Can I say on a weekend? On a weekend I usually tidy up.R: You can say on a weekend, yeah. It's like saying on any given weekend. Like if you talk about what you do in general. Maybe any given would be better. On any given weekend, I could be found cleaning up because I'm dead exciting that way.M: But usually we say on the weekend. I usually do something on the weekend. And also I like weekends. And the weekend is usually what? Like Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, right? Four days?R: Well, my entire week is a weekend, now that I have all this free time. No, a weekend... Well, now, from the Western perspective, because I teach students now from Iran and Turkey and Israel and all over the place. So weekends, where I am from, they're the evening on Friday and Saturday and Sunday. But if you're in Iran, apparently, your weekend is something like... Is it Friday and Saturday? Those are your two big weekend days.M: Wow. Interesting.R: Yeah, it's really strange. It depends on where you are, but it's what's considered to be the end of the week. The part between one working week and the next working week, whatever is in between those things. If you are from Iran, then please correct me, because I think I've just made a huge mistake. But I know that the weekends are different because my student was talking to me.M: So you unwind on the weekend. Okay? So you relax on the weekend or unwind. And Rory said \"I can unwind from all the work\" and also I can unwind, I can relax from all the work I had to get through. So we get through a lot of work. Well, we have work, we do our work. So on the weekend, I can finally unwind from all the hard work I had to get through during the week. And also, you can say that I usually catch up on some rest. So another phrasal verb - to catch up on some rest.R: All of the hard work that I do now.M: And then you used another synonym. So I wind down on the weekend or you said \"typically, I wind down on Friday evenings\".R: So unwind and wind down. Both are words for relaxing, because we should relax at our weekends. To be honest, we should be relaxing all the time, but weekends will have to do for some of us.M: And Rory was Rory. Like a typical Rory, he said I spent Sunday cleaning, ah, clearing. Clear, clearing up.",

      "M: What kind of music do you like to listen to?R: Well, it would be easier to talk about the kind of music I don't listen to, to be honest with you. You just need to look at my playlist on YouTube and you can see it, it encompasses like the full range of genres right now. Although, at the moment it's like... It's remixes of old pop songs, mostly, now that I think about it.M: When did you start listening to that type of music?R: Well, it's hard to pin down exactly when. Like what? Since the algorithm occasionally throws me a curveball and I wind up going down a bit of a rabbit hole. Although I would say it would be around about the time I started going to the gym properly. When I needed music with like a good beat and lyrics that I could listen along to while I work out.M: How much time do you spend listening to music every day?R: I have absolutely no idea. I would say at least an hour or so. I mean, sometimes more than that, if I'm at the gym and I ramp the volume up on a tune.M: When do you listen to music?R: Well, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, whenever I go to the gym, really. Or when I go for a walk. I also like it when my friends share music with me as well. I suppose, when my friends share music that happens at random intervals, the gym's more frequent. I don't do it whenever I work or read, though. I don't... I have no idea how people can do that kind of thing. It's very distracting.M: How do you feel when you listen to music?R: I think it depends on the activity I'm doing. So for example, when I'm at the gym, it leaves me feeling pumped up and ready to do whatever the routine requires of me. It enhances the feeling of relaxation whenever I'm out walking. And whenever I'm with friends, it can add to the general humour. Actually, if we make up our own lyrics to the songs as well.",

      "M: So music. We listen to music, right? Don't forget this to, not two like two, but listen to something. Listen to us, listen to Rory, don't listen to Rory, don't listen to anything but our premium episodes. So listen to music. And Rory, you told us something about your playlist on YouTube. So it's on YouTube?R: Yeah. A playlist is just a collection of music that's been put together. Usually by you or in my case, by the YouTube algorithm, because I'm far too lazy to do it myself.M: And your playlist encompasses the full range of genres.R: There's everything on there. Like it was pop from the 90s the other day and today it was classical music. So yeah, there's a lot.M: But if I say something encompasses something. So it kind of it includes different things or types, right?R: Yeah.M: So for example, I can say that this festival encompasses everything from music to food, for example, yeah? It kind of, it includes. So this is a nice one. You can say like, okay, I listen to different genres, genres, like musical genres. And my playlist encompasses the full range of genres, like different genres. And Rory prefers remixes of popular songs, yeah?R: Well, right now I do. Or rather right now the algorithm thinks I prefer remixes of popular songs. But a remix is just someone modifying the original music to add a new beat or to add in a new sound or to bring together elements of other songs.M: It's hard to pin down when exactly. So to pin down is a nice phrasal verb, okay? So it's hard to say, it's hard to kind of, you know, to pin down. When you have a pin and you kind of like pin, pin. Rory, help me out with the explanations. I'm running out of ideas.R: When you pin something down, if something is hard to pin down, then it's hard to say any... Now, I don't know. Actually, now we're struggling to pin down the meaning of the phrase to pin down. No, to pin down means to give the exact definition or description of something. If something is hard to pin down, then it's difficult to give an exact definition or exact information about it. There! I pined it down.M: Rory, we need more examples. Come on, native speaker.R: What? Well, it's difficult to pin down the origins of... Oh, God, I don't know... Social media, because I know nothing about it. Or it's hard to pin down where the word glass comes from. I'm just looking at the glass there. I don't know where the word glass comes from. Again, because I know nothing about it. So if something is vague or mysterious, then it's difficult to pin down.",

      "M: Do you like modern or traditional art?R: I'm not sure where you're drawing the distinction, if you'll pardon the pun. But, I suppose, I prefer both for different reasons. Modern art is more relatable to my life because I'm a modern person. But traditional art appeals to higher, more universal concepts, at least in my opinion.M: Why do some people dislike art?R: Well, I doubt they dislike it in general. I suppose, they probably just like a specific form that isn't to their taste. For example, like biologically, we're supposed to be attracted to symmetry and symmetrical faces. So artwork that's not like that might be a bit off-putting.M: What's art?R: Well, that's not a difficult question at all, is it? I suppose if I'm pushed, then I would say that art is the attempt to capture or represent something that the artist finds engaging or beautiful. So, for example, the Mona Lisa is Da Vinci's attempt to capture the moment with this woman and the mystery that surrounds it, in my opinion.M: Would it be interesting for you to be an artist?R: If you mean, someone who makes paintings and does drawings for a living, then... Well, I would certainly be impressed. Although, I'm awful at both and I doubt my doodles would be worth much, to be honest with you. And I doubt most people would benefit from it, though. I'm much better off as a teacher.M: What artwork would you like to have in your house?R: Well, at this stage anything would be good for my bare walls, to be honest. I've collected a lot of indigenous and abstract art over the years. In addition to more traditional landscapes that would look good. I just haven't got around to hanging them up yet, I suppose. But I think they would complement the décor nicely. It's just a shame I'm not going to be living where I am for much longer.M: Thank you, Rory, for your answers!R: Very arty.",
    discussion:
      "M: So what's modern art?R: What is modern art?M: Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period from the 1860s to the 1970s. So, for example, Van Gogh, you know, Van Gogh, the sunflowers, is considered to be modern art. But what do you call art that is produced these days?R: Oh, is it going to be something like postmodern art then? Because it's after the modern period?M: Yes. Postmodern art or contemporary art.R: Well, I don't understand. Is modern and postmodern art, is it just about a time period? It's nothing to do with a style then?M: No, no, no. It's about the time period. So art today, we can call it contemporary art. Post-modern art, but modern art, it's not the art that is produced right now. It's just like Van Gogh, the 1860s, 1970s.R: I learned something new then. Like, I thought modern art was just modern art about now and traditional art was about things in the past. Or things that are more universal.M: And actually, I think the question is a bit strange because traditional art, what's traditional art? It's theatre, poetry, sculpture, drawing, painting, architecture, cinema. So that's traditional art.R: Yes. But again, I just think of like modern now, traditional in the past. Or at least strongly connected to the past, whereas modern is strongly connected to now. So there you go, I was wrong, but I still used high-level vocabulary. Can we please talk about the high-level vocabulary?M: You said that modern art is relatable to my life?R: Yeah. It's got a connection to my life. Or at least I thought it did. Now I'm thinking that maybe contemporary art has this connection. Sorry, I didn't do well art in school.M: And then Rory said that traditional art makes connections. So to make connections. Makes connections to something more universal. For example, like traditional art makes connections to universal concepts. Like love, beauty, the meaning of life.R: Yeah, that's how I would define it. And, I suppose, even though I got it wrong and I was factually incorrect, the fact that the grammar and vocabulary is high-level means that you'll still get a high score. So take that. Also, how many art teachers are IELTS examiners? Probably not many. And if you are, then you're in the wrong line of work, I suppose. Can we talk about the pun? I made a pun.M: Oh, you made a pun! Did you notice it?R: I did. I made a pun. Did you notice the pun?M: You are drawing the distinction. We're talking about art. And drawing is one of the art forms. So draw the distinction, tell the difference.",

So nobody but me knows that, nobody but me and the entire internet now.M: What kind of chores or housework do you usually do?R: Well, aside from general tidying up? I wipe down the surfaces and sweep the floor... Oh, and I hoover the floor too, actually. And, oh, I make the bed. I feel like that's not really serious housework, but it needs to be done.

Maybe one day I'll be able to afford one.M: What housework do you dislike?R: Well, don't really like any of it, frankly, but needs must.

Here, Rory, you used this far less than I used to. Hmm. Far less.R: Yeah. It just means a lot less. And really, it's... The whole thing should be, like, far less so. So a lot less. And so is used here to substitute, like far less often than I used to. So instead of repeating the question we use so.

It's only when I have an overnight stay or when I go on holiday that I'll have one.M: What do you usually put in your bag?R: Well, whenever I do have one, it's usually stuffed with clothes and toiletries and other miscellaneous items that I can't carry on my person. Like my laptop, for example. I can't drag that around with me. Although my current one is so small that I probably could if I wanted to. And then if we're talking about the tote bags that are used for shopping, then obviously they're filled with shopping.M: What factors do you consider when you buy a bag?R: Like I said, it's the number of pockets and compartments, really. I need to have a lot because there's lots of different bits and pieces I put in them. And something durable, something that can really go the distance because, well, unlike having something that's not going to fall apart that I have to worry about replacing. And... Oh yeah, something waterproof because, well, just given the weather conditions that I have to put up with, it's kind of essential.",

      "M: Hey, dear listener, so bags. Aren't you excited about bags?R: I am very excited for bags.M: Yeah, Rory is excited about bags. And you know what? When the examiner asks you a question, like: Do, like, bags? You can crack a joke, like: Oh, you mean like bags under my eyes? Because this... When you don't sleep and you have bags under your eyes. Rory, do you have bags under your eyes?R: Well, I was about to say. What if you're like me and you don't have bags under your eyes?M: If you don't have enough sleep, so you can have them, right? So you can crack a joke. So dear listener, bags under our eyes. And here we go. Bags are a fashion accessory. So this is the word for you. A fashion accessory. And we know that a proper look is not complete without a designer bag. A designer bag like Gucci, Prada, LV, Chanel... So we call them designer bags. Rory, of course, doesn't own one. So bags are a practical way to carry things. So we carry things in our bags. And also people make choices about different bags. And you can say something about fashion like: Oh yes, I love bags. Bags are the most important accessory to keep up with fashion along with clothes. Yeah? So we keep up with trends like fashion using different bags. And you also can say that women's handbags are considered a fashion statement, right? So for ladies, women's handbags, so careful, a woman, women, women's handbags. Right? So make sure that you do mention some kinds of bags. Right? Rory mentioned backpacks and rucksacks.R: Yes. What's the difference?M: I think a rucksack is more like a school kind of bag?R: Oh, really? I think the big difference is backpacks are smaller and for personal journeys or work, for example, whereas a rucksack is bigger and goes up mountains and things like that.M: So dear listener, if you are not sure you just can call it a bag. Anything is a bag. But to be more specific, so a rucksack, a backpack for men. Also, if you're a man that you can say something about wallets. Wallets, are kinds of bags. So you put your money in a wallet.R: Bags of money.M: For ladies. Ladies, we have so many different kinds and names for bags. So make sure you Google and then you choose maybe like two or three names. So to give you some, we can say something like a handbag, designer handbag, like a Prada handbag, even if you don't have it just say it. Also a clutch bag, a clutch, like a small clutch, you know, for the evening dress and stuff, a clutch or a purse. Right? So a clutch bag or a purse. Also, Rory showed us a tote bag. Okay, so a tote bag or a shopping bag. It's kind of like a large open bag with two handles. So these are called handles and yeah, a tote bag. Also we have a crossbody bag, a cross body bag. Across your body. Yeah, I know. You see? But this is cool because this is specific vocabulary, topic-specific vocabulary for your band nine. And also you can say like, the belt bag is really fashionable now, so the belt you just wear it here on your waist. Yeah? So the belt bag. Rory told us that you can fling things in the bag. So you fling things. So you just throw things into the bag, right? So you fling things. And you sling them over your shoulder. Am I correct? So you just like or put it on your shoulder, you sling them.R: Well, you're slinging very gently, clearly with my bags it would be like throwing it over my shoulder and being like, Yeah, I can just do that. I treat my stuff like rubbish because it's very durable. And I believe there was an idiom about durability. Something that can go the distance.",

      "M: What's your favourite wild animal?R: Oh, there are so many to choose from. But if you force my hand then I would say capybaras are... Well, I like capybaras the best. I just think they're a perfect representation of inner peace and calm that I would really like to have in my life. I do but I would like to have more of it. Like a capybara.M: Are there many wild animals in your country?R: Well, not unless you include the people, especially those people from Glasgow... Seriously, though, yeah, we do. We have foxes and badgers. And there are deer roaming around in the forests. And closer to the coast we have things like otters. I think there are lynxes somewhere as well, although I haven't seen those last two anywhere.M: Have you ever seen wild animals?R: In Scotland? Yeah, you can see deer in the meadows and the forests all the time. Although particularly in the morning when it's quiet because they're skittish, I suppose. And near the coastal areas, there are birds like seagulls and in between parts... So like in the rivers and in the coastal areas, you've also got herons, which are big... I suppose you would call them big birds that feed on aquatic life like fish. So you see them fishing there all the time.M: Where can you see wild animals in your area?R: Well, other than where I said already? I'm sure if you wandered deep into the forests, and the mountain ranges, they would probably see lots of wild animals wandering pretty much unfettered by humans. Unless they're near the roads, really. And there aren't many going through the mountains, to be honest.M: Do you like watching animals in the zoo?R: I used to but the more I think about it, the more I find myself actually being against zoos, to be honest. I think they're sort of almost like a species-wide excuse for destroying the natural habitats of other animals. And we think it's... Oh, it's perfectly fine, because we have them there in the zoo, and they're safe, and we can research them. But what a lot of people don't know is that these animals suffer from something called zoochosis which means that they repeat behaviours or engage in strange behaviours that they wouldn't normally in the wild, so you can't actually study them effectively. And also, it's cruel if that's happening to them anyway. So it's all a bit pathetic, really, in my opinion.M: Thank you Rory for your answers.",

It's the largest rodent, which leaves in South America. But now I've heard that in the States, it's legal to keep capybaras as pets.R: Oh, come on. Don't keep the capybaras as pets. Let them be free.M: Yep, it kind of... It looks like a huge guinea pig. All right? Please, if you have no idea what Capybara is, could you please google it now? CAPYBARAS.R: If you don't know what a capybara looks like, just look at my Instagram because half of my posts have capybaras in them... I love capybaras.M: You can say there are many animals that I enjoy, but if you force my hand, so if you force my hand, force it, like to make this choice, I'd go with capybaras or giraffes or pandas. I'd go with pandas, to be honest with you...R: But mostly capybaras...M: My favourite animals are pandas and capybaras...R: Why do you like pandas?M: Pandas are so cute and they are at ease. They do whatever they want. And they're funny as well. They do these things, and baby pandas are adorable. They're really cute.R: Okay, okay, fine. But baby, capybaras are also cute.M: Oh, yes, they are. But pandas are you know, big and fluffy. And also, this is... That's why. Capybaras are a perfect representation of inner peace and calm.R: Inner peace...M: And if you look at capybaras, they're usually in this lake surrounded by oranges and the water going down their heads and they're kind of like, yeah, zen...R: You can see them when they've got birds resting on their heads and noses and the birds are sitting there doing their thing and the capybaras are just like: Yeah, it's fine. Capybaras.M: Capybaras don't mind being alone. But they live in groups of up to 40 capybaras. So they kind of you know, flock together.",

      "M: Do you prefer rainy or sunnier days?R: Well, I think it depends where I am, to be honest with you. Like, if I'm indoors and it's night time, then it's really great to cosy up and drift off to the sound of the rain battering down. If I'm outdoors, however, it's a whole other kettle of fish. Because my skin doesn't do very well when I get soaked. So I would say I definitely prefer sunshine when I'm outdoors.M: What do you do on rainy days?R: Look out the window and be thankful that I'm not out there. I think, I have no idea, frankly. It will depend entirely on what's on the schedule. I mean, I won't melt if I go out. I'm not made of sugar. But... So if I have to go out, then I'll go out. But if I don't have to go out in the rain, then I definitely won't go out in the rain.M: What do you do if you get caught in the rain?R: I suppose if it's heavy, then finding a place to take shelter or something to shelter under would be a good idea. Although, that's rarely the case, to be honest. I just sort of soldier on and get where I need to be, really. Like I said, I'm not really made of sugar and I really catch colds in a downpour, so it's not a big deal for me.M: Is rain good?R: Well, for me personally, not unless you count it as a source of drinking water, to be honest. Otherwise, actually, it's a bit of a pain because my hair goes flat and my skin gets quite oily for some reason. So that's not great. But if we mean in general, then it's a good source of water for places with vegetation or places without erosion issues.M: Have you ever changed your plans because of rain?R: Not recently. I was out on a date a couple of weeks ago and it started to rain. And we had to pick up the pace to get to where we needed to be. But that's not really a change of plan, to be honest with you, because we were already heading there, weren't we?M: How does rain affect life in your country?R: Well, it's Scotland, so I think we're kind of used to it by now, to be honest. I think, we would probably notice it more of it didn't rain, frankly. Like I say, because we're so accustomed to it, we've got quite good drainage in most areas. Although in more exposed areas, if it's particularly nasty then it can cause mudslides and flooding. But that's not a regular occurrence, to be honest with you.",

      "M: So, dear listener, rain. It rains. It started to rain or it started raining, okay? It's rainy, it was a rainy day, right? And Rory told us that if I'm indoors when it rains, it's great or it's great to cosy up.R: Yeah. Is that a phrasal verb?M: It's a phrasal verb...R: Yes! What does it mean, though?M: Cosy up, when you kind of like you're at home, you are like... You're cosy :) You make yourself comfortable...R: You have a blanket or you're in bed and you're like...M: So I enjoy... It's great to cosy up at home when it rains. And it's a whole other kettle of fish when it rains and you're outside. It's an idiom. It's a whole other kettle. Kettle like this... With tea or fish, dear listener, okay?R: Well, actually, I think a kettle also means a big metal thing that you keep things in as well. But that's like a really really old meaning for it.M: So if you say that it's another kettle of fish or it's a whole other kettle of fish, it means it's something completely different...R: Yes.M: ...from what I've been talking about, right?R: You could just say it's something completely different, but idiomatic language for a high score, yay!M: So it's a different story, it's another kettle of fish. I get soaked, so in the rain, when you go out, it starts raining, you can get soaked. So like rain and you just... Everything is wet. So to get soaked in the rain, okay? Yeah. Rory, you said like it's battering down?R: Yes. That just means that the rain is coming down so heavily that you can hear it, like hitting the roof where you live. And it makes that drumming sound.M: So you can say it's pouring down or it's battering down. It rains heavily. And the collocation is heavy rain or it rains heavily, like heavy, you know? Or it's battering down. What does Rory do on rainy days? On rainy days, okay? It depends on my schedule or it depends on what's on the schedule, right?R: You kind of have to deal with it, though, because it's raining. Yes, it's terrible. But you just have to put up an umbrella and hope that everything stays reasonably calm. I wish I had an umbrella right now, but I don't actually own one.",

To be honest, that's probably underselling it frankly. He's one of the most capable people I know in terms of repairing and maintaining things.

My landlady once showed me how to unblock the pipes in my apartment. Although that was just a case of turning the taps on and waiting. I'm not sure if that counts as like fixing things or, or an effective solution to a problem. But at least she was trying to help.M: What was the last thing you broke in your home?R: Oh, this is gonna get me in trouble.

And here also you can say something about software. So I can deal with software packages, but I'm not really a tech savvy person. What are the basic repairs around the house? Dear listener, for this topic, you do need maybe like two, three phrases to name specific repairs. So first of all, replace a light bulb.R: Or screw a light bulb back in.M: Screws. Screw is like when you use a screwdriver, this instrument. If you're listening to this audio version, could you go to our YouTube channel and look at the pictures we're showing you because this vocabulary is pretty difficult.

Rory, go ahead.R: Sorry, a loose screw or to have a screw loose also means that you're crazy.M: Oh, okay.R: Have you never heard that before?M: No, no, I've heard like, oh, he's bonkers. Or he's off his head.R: Oh, well, in America, people get called screwy, which is kind of the same thing, if you're a bit nuts.M: Or you can have a wobbly chair, you know, a chair like... You know, like one leg is shorter than the other. Yeah, chair has four legs usually. And if the chair is wobbly, it goes... So you can build up a shorter leg. So you can level a wobbly chair. Oh my gosh, this vocabulary is band nine. Do you feel it? So you can say, oh, yeah, like I can handle basic repairs around the house. For example. I can level a wobbly chair. Band nine.

Whenever we went to the beach, and there was an ice cream van nearby. That was quite nice.M: Are there any shops selling ice cream near your home?R: I think so. There was a Tesco store at the garage just along the road from where I lived. It must have some. Not that I've ever looked for it. It's a pretty small place though. So I imagine it would be just sort of standard fare. Nothing terribly complex or intriguing in terms of flavour.M: Can you make ice cream yourself?R: I mean, I could if I had the time, and the ingredients and a recipe book. And patience. But I don't have any of those things. So not right now, sadly. Sorry.",
    discussion:
      "M: Hey, thank you Rory for your delicious answers! Ice cream. Do you like ice cream? Doesn't everyone? So the answer to this question could be a question like doesn't everyone like ice cream? Come on, like...R: Everybody likes ice cream.M: Yeah, like who doesn't like pizza? Come on.R: Where are these people?M: Yeah, but some people dislike ice cream. Okay. And we can say that different types of ice cream cater to almost every taste. So different ice cream producers cater to different tastes.R: Shall we talk about cater to?M: Yeah.R: So cater to means to make the effort, to help or to support something. And different tastes. Oh, every taste. It's a pub. Because you taste ice cream, but taste can also mean your preference.M: And you can say that some ice creams are lactose-free. So this lactose, this ingredient. Or sugar-free. You can also say that I prefer non-dairy ice cream. Like, without any milk, it's like a dairy product, a milk product. So no milk, non-dairy ice cream, or I prefer vegan options. Right? Or low-calorie ice creams with high protein, for example. And these days, did you know that they have plant-based ice cream?R: Oh, like, so no animal products in them at all?M: No. They use brown rice, they use organic cocoa powder. So pretty much everything is green, plants, and organic. No, you know, these chemicals in there. So yeah, plant-based ice cream.R: I hope there are no chemicals. Hold on, wait, if it's in the universe, then it's a chemical. What you mean is like harmful chemicals, right?M: Yeah, no harmful chemicals. And also you can say like, oh, if I have a sensitive stomach. A sensitive stomach. The stomach is this organ, yeah?R: It's where your food goes.M: Yeah. It's like, you eat some of these. Yeah? Like ice cream. And then your stomach feels funny. So I have a sensitive stomach. So I prefer plant-based ice cream. Sugar-free ice cream. And also here you can talk about different types of ice creams. Can I say ice creams?R: I don't see why not, to be honest. Because there are different kinds of ice... Well, I would say different kinds of ice cream. I consider it uncountable. But if we talk about the individual flavours, then yeah, but that's like super specific.M: Different ice creams, different flavours, tastes, yeah? And also different types. For example, sorbet. Gelato is Italian ice cream. Gelato. Ooh, gelato, banana gelato. Mamma Mia. Also, we can have some frozen yoghurt as a type of ice cream. Ice popsicle. Rory, what is an ice popsicle?R: Oh, you call them ice popsicles. Where I'm from, we just call them Ice Pops. But at least where I'm from an ice pop is... It's like a plastic tube that's filled with flavoured water basically and it gets frozen. And that's an ice pop. But you also have ice lollies. I don't know if they can be counted as ice cream though. I feel like the cream part of ice cream means it's got to have some kind of milk in it.",

And to be honest with you, I really like my job. So my life is almost like a perpetual holiday or time off.M: What do you usually do on your days off?R: Well, on my proper ones I like to read and relax and play video games. I'm trying to think of anything else really. But to be honest with you, it's quite important that I chill on my downtime. So I try not to do much.

So it's easy to see them when I'm out and about.M: When was the last time you had a couple of days off?R: Well, other than the weekends? I think that's about it. Oh, no. I think the last time I had like sort of an extended period of time off was when I went to see my friends Mike and Lana in New York. We spent a lot of time wandering around museums and galleries and talking about art.M: What would you like to do if you had a day off tomorrow?R: It depends on the weather. If it were warm out, then I would probably go for a walk in the countryside. But if it were a cold one, then I'd probably, well, do the things I described before.

I end up working anyway.M: How did you describe a holiday? You said something...R: Oh, a perpetual holiday. Yeah. If something is perpetual, it just means that it goes on and on forever. And that is what my life is like now, because I have a job that I love and I get to do what I like and I'm very relaxed about it most of the time.M: You can say it's a never-ending holiday.R: It is the never-ending holiday. It's great.M: Personal days off help us to recharge, to kind of relax and be more productive at work later. So we have a day off and then we are more productive at work. Rory chills on his downtime.R: Which makes me sound like I'm from California, like, chill on my downtime, man. I do chill on my downtime. It just means I relax when I have free time. To be honest, I relax when I'm working anyway.M: I try to read and play video games. So you see? So really interesting. What do you do? Just read, play video games. Okay, okay.R: I'm sorry, but those are my go-to activities.M: That's fine. Yeah, my go-to activities. You see? So, okay, I usually, I go for a walk and I play video games. Those are my go-to activities. These are the things I do. Yeah?R: Yes, it's almost automatic. It's like, oh, I have 30 minutes. I can play games.M: I've been reading about three main categories for day off activities. Okay, Rory? Relaxation, productivity and pleasure. Dear listener, I'm going to give you a list, write in the comments what activities do you prefer. Okay? Rory, also, you can choose. So take a bath. Declutter your closet. Declutter is kind of when you declutter, you throw away unnecessary things, old things. So you declutter. You kind of empty it, you create more space, and by throwing out different things you don't need. Do laundry, you wash your clothes, do laundry. Very productive.R: None of these things sound very relaxing to meM: No, this is like productivity. Take a bath, about relaxation, productivity. Declutter your closet, do laundry, rearrange your bookshelves. Rearrange the books. Mend your clothes. If your clothes have holes, so you kind of you mend it. Mend. Right?

And that's been working wonders, generally speaking.M: What healthy habits do you have?R: Well, I don't smoke or drink to excess very often. So that's usually enough. Well, I also try and eat things that match up with my gut flora, so I don't get overly bloated. And I try and get my full eight hours of sleep every night. I think those are the main things.M: Do you have any unhealthy habits?R: Not many, although I occasionally overindulge in alcohol, and maybe eat a little bit too much. But that's not very often and at least when I do it's the good stuff, so I don't feel so bad about it.M: Did you have any health classes at school?R: Well, we had home economics and social education in high school. And I have to say that despite the best intentions of the teachers, they weren't terribly effective. I don't think much of the information was readily applicable, at least to students in my situation, and the way that I lived my life and continued to live my life. And there's also the matter of delivery. I don't really think that hectoring students and acting holier-than-thou is a great way to inspire people to do the right thing. There were very few like level-headed discussions about what it really means to be healthy. So that was a bit unfortunate. Sorry about that.M: Do you have any advice on keeping healthy for youngsters?R: Well, what? Other than don't smoke and try and eat in a way that matches your body? Or matches up with the makeup of your body. I don't know what else I could say. Like, I suppose we could talk about mental health. And in that case, it's just trying to ask yourself if something is really a big deal, or if you're making a mountain out of a molehill and unnecessarily stressing yourself, but I can't give any more specific advice for young people because I don't live their lives like a lot of old people that give advice to younger people.",

What do I do to keep healthy? Rory told us like I lead a very active life. So to lead an active life or to lead a stress-free life. So I'm stress-free. I have an active life. Or if you're passive, you lead a sedentary life. And I have a regular diet. So maybe Rory eats everything. Maybe he's not on a diet but the food Rory eats is regular and healthy. And that's been working wonders since I started it. So this is a very nice phrase for you to remember. It has been working wonders. So to work wonders? Like oh, it's been magic.R: It's very effective.M: It has been working wonders since I started. Work wonders. It's really effective. It's like magic. So it has been. Present Perfect Continuous. Since I started. I started a long time ago. Also, dear listener, you can add things like I keep fit. So kind of you do regular exercise. I eat a well-balanced, low-fat diet. Not just a regular diet, but you can just squeeze in some nice words. I drink water to stay hydrated. Hydrated. I reduce screen time to be healthy. I get enough sleep. So they are kind of usual things, yeah? But like good chunks of language. I go easy on alcohol. Like I stay sober. Sober? like no alcohol. And Rory, you go easy on alcohol, right?R: Yeah, I don't drink to excess, which is the... I suppose it's the technical term for not getting drunk all the time.M: You can say that I manage my stress, or I practice daily gratitude. Mindfulness. Yeah, I get massages, I do breathing exercises, breathing. So these are like nice chunks. Even if you don't do anything, dear listener, okay? It's just for vocabulary, lexemes.R: If you're uncomfortable with it, then you could always say like I try to. I try to do regular meditation or breathing work.M: I do my best to do breathing exercises. So healthy habits, unhealthy habits. And you said that I don't smoke to excess?R: No, I don't smoke period, but I don't drink to excess. I don't think you can smoke to excess unless you were like trying to give yourself lung cancer or something like that.M: Like if a person is a chain smoker.R: Well, drinking to access is drinking so much that you make yourself ill. Whereas smoking generally makes you ill. You can smoke to access by telling people do that intentionally. Whereas people definitely intentionally drink to excess.M: I eat things that match up with my gut flora. So your guts are pretty much like in your stomach, or in this area. Gut flora. So something inside there. So food that match things. Things that match up with my stomach.R: Yeah, well, not just your stomach, but all of your digestive system, I suppose. Because everybody's got unique bacteria inside them. So really, everybody should be on their own unique diet.M: Get bloated, you just like get bigger and you feel that... It's a huge stomach.R: Yeah, it's not a nice feeling.",

What did you mean when you said I used to be plagued with self-doubt?R: It just means that, oh, how best to describe it? If you're plagued by something, it means that there's always or there was always something negative in the background. And in this case, it was constant doubt like, oh, you can't do this. You can't be a teacher. Like constant thoughts in my head. And because that was happening all the time. It was like a disease almost. So you could say that you... Or I said I was plagued by it.M: So can you say I was plagued with or by something? Right?R: I think played by is the most often one. Passive voice, yes.M: So I was plagued by doubt. I was plagued by what? Well, something negative?R: Oh, plagued by... Well, just plagued by negative thoughts to be honest with you, or plagued by nightmares, but it's always something negative.M: At school, I was plagued by nightmares. I had nightmares all the time, or I was plagued by negative thoughts. So I was like, full of negative thoughts. When you talk about school use \"used to\" because you went to school, not anymore. Right? So I used to be plagued by different thoughts or self-doubt. You can say, for example, I'd love to be a teacher, because I'm a natural-born educator. I'd love to be an educator and work at school. Or you can say I'm an amusing person, and it's gonna be fun working with students.R: Can I tell you what charge GPT said?M: Oh, what?",

Dear listener, it's interesting that when you hear Friday, you kind of feel happiness. Because Fridays are the happiest days of our working week. Yeah?

But it's great, but still kind of like, it's kind of it seems weird, strange. And it's interesting that I've read some research, and they researched it, that days of the week.

That's to do with what you're doing on the day.M: Yeah, but it's kind of like the day is associated with these things.R: Only if you're a slave to your job.

      "M: How important are friends to you?R: Well, they're pretty indispensable, I think. I'm not sure where I would be without them, to be honest. I think they keep me sane and grounded. But at the same time, we also have fun together. And I wouldn't have as much fun without them as I do know. So yeah, they're, they're extremely important.M: What do you usually do with your friends?R: Well, I think it depends on the group, really. All of my friends are very different. For example, there's a group of friends that I have from high school. And you could say they're my school friends. Even though we went to different schools, we all met when we were in high school. And then there are friends that I met after high school, and both of these groups I do extremely different things with. So with one group I go shooting, for example, sometimes, or wild activities like that. And with another group of friends, we go out partying together.M: What kind of friend would you like to meet in the future?R: A good one. I think the thing about my friendships is that they're all a bit random and situational. So the friends that I met from when I was in high school, we all met through a random series of coincidences, not through being in the same school, but through knowing other people, and just being in the right place at the right time at the right party. And the same is true for the ones that I met out of school. So it was all just random connections through knowing people. And because we found that we had a lot of things in common, we became friends. It's really strange, because of course, most people meet friends in school, and the people that they're looking forward to being friends with in the future, they would say they're at work, or they have some kind of hobby in common or some sort of situation. But it's not like that for me, it's a bit weird.M: What kind of people do you like to have as friends?R: Well, I know most people gravitate towards people or those who are like them, but my friendship group is really eclectic. I'm friends with some people who I have almost nothing in common with. For example, I have a friend Steve who is a goth. And I'm obviously not a goth, because I'm too lazy to invest that kind of time in my lifestyle. And I have another friend Rob. He's very into like sort of music by pop divas. And again, he knows like all of this history about them. And I know absolutely nothing about that because again, it's not something that I have a great interest in. And obviously, the two people I'm describing there are extremely different. And their lifestyles are very different as well. So I can't answer that question with a succinct answer, I'm sorry.M: Do you prefer to spend time alone or with friends?R: Well, I like my own company for the most part, but I'm not going to just sit by myself forever. So when I'm in the mood to be around people, I really appreciate this time with them. But if I have to be clear about what one I would choose, it's spending time by myself.M: Thank you, Rory, for your extraordinary answers!R: Yeah, sorry. All of my friendships are a bit weird. So talking about friendship is kind of an odd one for me.",
    discussion:
      "M: Yeah, dear listener, and here, Rory tells us the truth. So he can't possibly lie about anything, even in our episodes. So everything hear is true about Rory.R: Maria would prefer it if I did lie, and said like, yes, all of my friends are very conscientious people. They all fit into neat little boxes. And that's how life is. No, life is not like that.M: No, he gives us a lecture on how his friends are all different. And how he can't answer this question.R: Well, I can't like I don't think I can. It's a strange one. But then I think, I think if most people really thought about it, they would realize that their friends and their friendships and the relationships they have are all very different and have their own unique stories, which is one of the cool things about being alive.M: Yeah.R: Well imagine like how we're friends because we met at work, but became friends through our insane quest to keep this podcast going in the middle of a pandemic. Somehow.M: Friends are pretty indispensable. Indispensable - C-2 level proficiency. So somebody or something that's indispensable is so good or important you can't manage without them. AlrightR: Like Maria on the podcast, or Vanya on the podcast.M: Yeah, Maria is indispensable. Rory is indispensable. So it's so good and important, like we can't do this podcast without Rory. Or Maria or Vanya. Or this podcast, dear listener, is indispensable for you. Right? You can't possibly imagine your life, your IELTS life without this podcast, right? Yeah. For some people, our premium episodes are indispensable. They're so important and valuable and good that some listeners, they just can't imagine their life without our premium episodes. Make sure you check out the link in the description. Okay? And also our phrasal verb course is indispensable. When you prepare for your speaking and you want like seven or eight or nine. Because we give you phrasal verbs. And phrasal verbs are indispensable for your high IELTS score for speaking. Right. Rory, you told us friends keep you sane and grounded. What did you mean?R: They... Well, I mean sane is not crazy and grounded is, well, attached to reality. So they're all to do with being mentally stable.M: And someone who is grounded makes good decisions. Doesn't say or do stupid things. Like he is very grounded. Yeah? He makes good decisions.R: Me?M: For example, like Rory is... No, Rory is not... Sometimes.R: What do you mean I'm not grounded?M: No, Rory is grounded. Yeah, yeah, you are, you are.R: Well, most of the time, sometimes no.",

So for example, when I have to do assignments for the course I'm on right now, I start off strong and then my attention drifts and I wind up looking at my phone or something like that.M: What do you do to improve your concentration?R: Oh, not much, to be honest. I should probably be more proactive in terms of taking action. But some things I do when I really have to, to concentrate that is, are turning off my notifications or even just my whole phone if there's a lot of work I need to get done.M: How do you stay focused?R: Other than what I just said, I suppose I remind myself of how much better things will be once I have my task out of the road. Like in the case of the assignments, for example, I think about, oh, when it's done, then I can do something fun. Like read or play computer games.M: When is it hard for you to concentrate?R: Oh, when people are blithering away to me and I'm clearly trying to do something like reading a book. I can't stand it when someone comes up to me and asks, what are you reading? And I have to say, well, nothing now that you're talking to me. It's really annoying. So when people distract me is the big thing.M: What else may distract you?R: Well, other than other people? I think phones are a pretty big attention and time sink regardless of what you're doing on them. Or just intrusive or random thoughts. And of course the obvious things like sudden noises or unexpected events, I think all of them can draw your attention away from things.M: Thank you Rory for your focused answers!R: I hope everybody was concentrating on them.",
    discussion:
      "M: Yeah, dear listener, so we say to be concentrated on something, to concentrate or focus on something, to be a focused person. Right? What other synonyms can we have? I'm focused, I'm very focused.R: That's it. Paying attention to something.M: Yeah, paying attention to something. While I can get things done, so get things done. So do things. You can say while I do something, or you can say while I get things done, my attention often wanders. Meaning your attention is somewhere else.R: You're not focusing on what you should be.M: Yeah. So what's the pronunciation? Like wander, wander?R: Wander. Well, I say wander.M: Wander. Yeah. wanders. Kind of like walks away. Yeah? So your attention is somewhere else. And also a synonym is my attention drifts. Could you give us another example with drifts? Drifts like walks away from the thing I should be focusing on.R: If someone is talking to me without saying anything interesting, my attention tends to drift, or my mind drifts or my attention wanders.M: My attention wanders, my mind tends to drift or wanders away from my work, right? And when I want to get things done, I could wind up looking at my phone, wind up doing something or end up doing something. And you know how it's done, dear listener, yeah? You start doing something and then kind of, you look at your phone and you end up writing texts, or you end up browsing through your Instagram account. So wind up doing or end up doing something are really nice phrasal verbs for you here. I should be more proactive in terms of taking action. So to be proactive? Not to be passive but to be active. Yeah?R: Just think in advance and be ready to deal with things.M: Yeah, like, take a proactive role. So take action, yeah? Change something. But Rory is not so proactive in terms of improving his concentration.R: I'm not, I could be more but I'm not.M: I turn off my notifications. So on your phone, you have notifications, which pop up all the time. Yeah? So turn off my notifications when I need to get some work done. You see? I need to get it done. Or there's a lot of work I need to get done. Really nice phrases. So to get things done, I've got a lot of work to do. Or there's a lot of work I need to get done. Rory reminds himself of something. So you can remind yourself of something or like to do something or like I should remind myself to turn off notifications?R: Well, I could do that. Or I could remember it in the moment.M: But grammar-wise, is it correct? Like remind myself to turn them off?R: Yeah. Remind yourself to do something.M: I have my tasks out of the road.",

Oh, I also learned Swedish when I lived there, I nearly forgot about that one.M: How did you learn those languages?R: To be honest, my French was more about resisting the teacher and messing around. But there was a lot of book learning, so it wasn't very engaging anyway. For Swedish we had speaking classes, and for Russian, I used Duolingo, and classes and just living in Russia to pick things up. My Turkish is only learned via Duolingo with the occasional fragmented conversation.M: Would you like to learn any foreign language?R: Any more? I mean, it's a bit late in the day, but I like the idea of learning Chinese, though there might be limits to how successful that might actually be now.M: Do you think it's difficult to learn a new language?R: Oh, absolutely. It's a whole new system of seeing the world and talking about it for you to absorb. And you're never really finished. Despite that, though, it's well worth the effort. You can meet some amazing people and have a lot of fun if you just keep at it.M: Will you learn another language in the future?R: Oh, I don't know. I think four is pretty much my limit, really. It's difficult enough speaking to people from different parts of my own country. I might try out Chinese though, now that we've talked about it.",
    discussion:
      "M: So, dear listener, languages. First of all, we learn languages or we study languages. Rory, can we use both of these verbs? Learn a language, study language.R: Yeah, but I think they mean slightly different things if you think about it, because learning a language is like about using it as a skill, whereas studying the language would be about understanding the mechanics behind it and the grammar rules, this sort of thing. So they're used interchangeably, but in fact, they mean very different things.M: But usually you say like, I'm studying English, I learned French at school. Yeah?R: Yes.M: And Rory told us he learned French in school. Right? So learned, -ed, or you can say learnt. Right? So both options are possible. I learned French in school. And I've been studying Russian for eight years. So a good structure, if you're still learning a language, or you can make it up, imagine that you are studying Chinese now. So how long have you been studying this language? I've been studying Chinese or I've been studying English for 10 years for two years. So make sure you use present perfect continuous in this context. So I've been learning English for 10 years. I've been studying English for 20 years. And, Rory, you learnt Swedish.R: I did, yeah. Well, I've learned isolated phrases and of course the swear words. But that's about it.M: Come on, come on. Let's hear it.R: No, I'm not swearing in Swedish. That's horrible.M: No, not swear words, but some kind of say hi, my name is Rory in Swedish. Come on.R: It's easier in Swedish because like hello is hej. And how are you I think is hur mår du. Good luck is Lycka till. I'm not using the pronunciation right at all. Because, like when you listen to actual Swedish people, it's much more musical, more pleasant to listen to than I sound.M: Sweet. Rory's French was more about resisting the teacher.R: It was awful. I hated French at school.M: Resist the teacher like you disagree with the teacher, you resist it, like resist arrest, like the police want to arrest you and you kind of resist the arrest. So resist the teacher. And Rory was messing around. So he went to his French classes and he was, he wasn't doing much, he was just having fun, doing nothing, so he was messing around. So you can say like, oh, my French in school was about messing around. I wasn't learning much. But there was a lot of book learning. So the phrase, there was a lot of book learning. What did you mean by this?R: It just means that we did a lot of work in textbooks, there was no actual practice of the language in an authentic context or way. But then there were 30 people in the class and we're all teenagers all misbehaving all the time, and then everything else that you have to deal with. So it's no surprise that nobody, well, at least no one in my group learned hardly anything, to be honest with you. So dear listener, if you only used a course book, and you didn't speak much, there wasn't much practice you can say there was a lot of book learning, so I didn't like the classes. Studying language should be engaging. This is the adjective, engaging, when the teacher engages you. When you are active, when you speak actively, like you, it's kind of real life. You engage in real-life conversations. So that was an engaging.",

Those are the ones where I see the money coming out of my account regularly.M: How do you usually pay your bills, in cash or by another method?R: They're all by direct debit, actually, with the exception of the gym membership, which I mean, the last time I paid for that it was in cash. And that was just because I had some cash on me and it saved time instead of faffing around with a card.M: Have you ever forgotten to pay a bill?R: Oh wow. I probably shouldn't share this too freely, because I might get in trouble. But I haven't paid my gym membership for the last three weeks. Because they haven't asked me. But I've justified it. Because I already paid for it before and they haven't improved anything in the gym, despite bringing up the price of the membership. So that's how I'm, that's how I make myself feel better about not paying for it. I kind of accidentally on purpose forgot to pay it.M: Is there anything you could do to make your bills cheaper?R: Other than just not paying them? I sometimes shopped around for new phone providers, this is not very often because, you know, I have my contract for a standard two-year period. But when that time is up, I shop around for different providers and sometimes, if you make that clear what you're doing, then they reduce the bill. And sometimes the company that you're already with to thank you for your loyalty will also bring down the price. But those are the two things I can imagine right now, or I can think of right now. I don't really know any other ways to reduce your bills.M: Thank you Rory for your honest answers!R: Too honest.",

We talk about electricity, gas, phone bill. So something you pay... Usually, you pay for them, right?R: Usually.M: So you measure it on a monthly, yearly basis. For example, they send us a bill for electricity or for the Internet. But also in the restaurant, dear listener, you say, oh, excuse me, can I have the bill, please? So the bill, you pay the bill. Wait for the joke. Okay? The joke is coming. It's a good one.R: People are getting a lot out of this episode. So far, we've had confessions of criminal offences taking place. Details about bills. Vocabulary is coming. And then Maria's joke. So lots to look forward to.M: So we pay our bills. And Rory told us, I pay my most regular bills. So regular bills, Rory pays every month. So phone, the internet bill, electrical bill.R: It can be the electricity bill too.M: Electricity bills. Yeah. But what about utilities? Can I say utility bill?R: That is such a good phrase. I would say pay the utilities or pay a utility bill.M: Pay the utilities. Utilities? Well, services, like electricity, gas. So pay the utilities. Or utility bills. Also, it's possible. Like we pay $5,000 every month plus the utilities, electricity, gas.R: Who pays $5,000 every month? What for?M: For example. And you pay monthlyç So every month, right? You can also talk about your subscriptions. Dear listener, do you have a Netflix subscription? Yeah? Or you pay, for example, for our premium. We have our premium episodes. And maybe you are one of our premium listeners, who pays on a monthly or yearly (every year) basis for our premium. Or for example, if I have a mortgage. I took out a loan for a house. So every month, what do I do, Rory? I pay for...R: You pay it monthly.M: Monthly, yeah. I pay for my mortgage, right? You can pay your bills in cash. In cash or what?R: By direct debit. You can pay them by credit card or by cash. A direct debit is a monthly or it's a regular payment that you set up on your account.M: So you set it up, and then every month it just...R: It just goes automatically.",

    conversation:
      "M: So, Jessica, you heard our introduction, right? How was it for you? Was it natural? Were you okay with that?J: I mean, no, a lot of those idioms are cliche at this point. And native speakers don't use them a lot. If this is an idiom, like raining cats and dogs, you know, that is a great example. Because that is one idiom I tell my students like never to use, really, because like, nobody says that. But if it's an idiom that you learned in your first year of English, or you've seen it on three or more idiom lists online, then like don't say it.M: So it's raining cats and dogs is an old idiom, nobody uses it. Right? Rory, would you use it?R: Well, I would, but not to convey the meaning about the weather, you would use it to make people laugh like we did in our opener, which is a use for English, but it's not something general. That's a very specific use. It's like the irony, I think. It's not the real meaning that you want to convey to people.J: I mean, that's why we use any cliche, right? Because we're using it in a sarcastic way. So we let the other person know, like I'm making a joke, this is cheesy. And then everybody laughs.M: What would you say? How can we make it more natural? So if it's raining heavily, just like... Like what can you say?J: I'd say like it's raining buckets, or it's pouring outside, right? So pouring isn't exactly an idiom. I guess it's used idiomatically in that sense, right? Because the water is pouring from the sky or gushing from the sky, right? But I would say, yeah, it's like raining buckets. I say that a lot.M: So the neutral option is like it's pouring down. It's British and American. Right?J: Yeah. I wouldn't say bucketing. We don't say that here.",

      "M: Ou next idiom is It's not my cup of tea. For example, I did yoga yesterday, and it wasn't my cup of tea. Jessica, would you say that?J: Again, like Rory noted earlier, I would say it to be funny. And, guys, like when you're doing that, I know this is hard to convey as a non-native. Like sarcasm. How do I do that? That's a really difficult language skill in another language, and it's all about intonation. You know what I mean? It has to be high and extreme like it's not my cup of tea. It's really just like high descending intonation, and then I know that or they know that I'm joking. I would just say like, that's not really my thing.M: Yeah, that's not my thing. You see, dear listener. Or I did yoga yesterday. That wasn't my thing.J: Isn't that a British English idiom instead of... Would you like some tea? Like what, do you want a cuppa? I've seen it in movies. Rory, is that a thing?R: Is it an idiom? Or is it just like one of these weird expressions that it has a name that I've forgotten right now, but it is a British thing? Yes. For tea specifically, you don't ask someone if they want a cup of bourbon.J: That'd be a lot of Bourbon.M: Why not? Would you like a cup?R: Oh, God.J: Maybe I would.R: And then go blind afterwards. If we talk about it's not my cup of tea, then I would. It's like Jessica said, it's not my thing, it's not really my thing or it wasn't really my thing. Although you could maybe take the edge off. It's not my cup of tea by saying it's not really my cup of tea like adding in the really there might break it up a little bit. But it's not the first thing I would reach for.J: And here's the thing, like, listeners, sometimes I think students hear an episode like this. And they think, well, why are you telling me what people don't use? You know what I mean? But here's another reason why this is useful is because the amount of pop culture that everyone takes in these days, right? Movies from all the years, about all the years, TV shows, music, books, you're gonna see and hear these idioms all over the place. They are cliches for a reason. You know what I mean? Because they're used all the time, they have been, so it is useful to know what they mean and recognize them. But it's better to say these other alternatives we're giving you.",

And you're, you're stuck because it's just, it's a new situation, and you have no idea what to do.M: Imagine you're sitting there and somebody just like puts all the light on you, on the spot. And you're kind of like... So the strategy is you say this sentence and then you give the answer. It's not just like, oh, you put me on the spot with this one.R: That's all.M: Next.R: We're done. Next question.M: Yeah, you should give the answer, right? But this sentence helps you to buy some time to think. For example, I'm gonna now ask some IELTS Speaking questions and Rory is gonna use this phrase naturally. Okay, Rory? Naturally.R: I will try.M: Are libraries popular in your country?R: Oh, you put me on the spot with that one. I would say they're not as popular as they used to be. But we do have a cost of living crisis in this country, so they're probably still quite well-frequented.M: So Rory here said you put me on the spot with that one. Or you said this one?R: It can be this one or that one. Because you're referring to something that has come previously. So it actually draws a nice connection between what you're saying now and what's been said previously.M: Another question, Rory. Is it important to study stars?R: Oh, you put me on the spot with this one. Well, if you're an astronomer, then it's very important to study the stars because that's your whole job. And if you didn't do it, then, well, you wouldn't keep your job, I suppose.M: Are historical films popular in your country?R: Oh, you put me on the spot with this one. I would say... Well, again, they're more popular than they used to be because you have all these blockbuster films like Oppenheimer coming out now. Also, people who produce Oppenheimer pay me money for advertising.M: You use this phrase once in your exam. Okay? Now we're just giving you examples.R: Yes. Just one time.M: Yeah, just once. Okay? Please!R: The clue is in the phrase, this one, one time, that's it. You only have one.M: Okay, phrase number two.R: Ooh.M: Our favourite phrase. Rory, could you read it out?",

      "M: I'm not an expert. But if I were to guess, if I were, the second conditional if I were to guess. You can say if I was to guess, like I'm imagining, I'm guessing, but we use the second conditional. For example, do you think climate change will affect water sports in the future?R: Well, I'm not an expert. But if I were to guess, then probably. I imagined if the sea levels are rising, then there will be more water for water sports to happen.M: So you see, this sentence is very good if you're asked a very specific question. This question, like climate change will affect water sports in the future. It's very specific. I'm not an expert. Okay? On climate change. I'm not an expert on watersports. Really, I don't know. But if I were an expert, I'd say, I would say that, you see? So use this phrase for a very specific question, usually for a difficult question. Alright? Another one. Is it hard to protect historical buildings?R: Oh, well, I'm hardly an expert. But if I were to guess then I would say probably because they're made from different materials to the ones that are used to make buildings now. So you'd have to match it up somehow. Or at least be very careful that you didn't damage them by accident.M: I'm hardly an expert. Hardly? Kind of like I'm not really.R: It's like there's the expert and then you. Very little.M: Like I'm hardly an expert. Really, I'm not an expert. But if I were to guess I'd say that. How does rain affect life in your country?R: Oh, well, I'm hardly an expert on meteorology, but if I were to guess, I would say that it probably has quite a significant effect, actually, especially on the West Coast where it's more exposed. So if they have more rain over there, then that could cause quite significant disruption to traffic.M: If you use this phrase, do not be like a robot, dear listener. I am hardly an expert but if I were to guess, just to say the phrase. No, no, no, you should mean it.R: Yeah. Because you're confused.M: You see? You should mean it. Okay? So no robotic usage. Okay? No monotonous usage.R: And you can add things in. Like, I'm hardly an expert or the kind of expert you would be. So for example, I said, I'm hardly an expert in meteorology, Scottish meteorology.

      "M: Is fishing popular in your country?R: Apparently. I've discovered recently that it's quite common for people to go up north and go salmon fishing there. And then just on the other side of the water on the farther shore, you see lots of guys going there with their fishing rods and keepnets. So it seems like it's quite a common thing.M: Do you like eating fish?R: Oh, yeah. I've always loved seafood. My favourite is salmon. Whether it's a steak or if it's smoked salmon, it's immaterial. I think I'd probably eat it for lunch and dinner, well, every lunch and dinner if I could.M: Have you ever been to a place where there are lots of fish around you?R: Yeah, I went scuba diving in Fiji and I was surrounded by all sorts of sea life there. There were sharks and rays and all sorts of fish darting in and out from the different coral reefs as well. And, well, closer to home there's also a sea life centre, and that showcases the fish from cooler climes in much clearer water. So if you're interested in that kind of thing, then you can head there.M: Have you seen any movies with lots of fish?R: I used to watch and rewatch this National Geographic documentary on, well, it's just life in the Caribbean Sea in general. But it also focused on the fish there. And growing up I loved the Jaws movies. I think more recently, oh, yeah, one of the last ones I saw were the Piranha movies. It's like a horror movie that shows different schools and shoals of these killer fish.M: Why do people go fishing?R: Well, I mean, the most obvious answer would be to catch fish. But that's not exactly very complex, is it? So, in more depth, angling is quite a popular sport where I live. And... So it could just be for sport. Or in some places, it's like a way of life. There's a... I think there's a tribe in Madagascar that I was reading about recently that, that they've specialized everything about life in their village to be focused on harvesting things from the sea. So like I say, for them, it's a way of life.",
    discussion:
      "M: Hey! Thank you for your answers! Dear listener, you don't need to fish for vocabulary or for ideas about fishing because we've just given you all these fish for ages. In 2020 we had an episode about fish and fishing, so it's a comeback. Okay? So make sure you listen to our episodes in September 2020.R: Oh my god, did we talk about this before?M: Yes.R: Wow. I do not remember that. So maybe it's time for me to take a trip down memory lane.M: A lot of people go salmon fishing. Salmon is a type of fish. We usually eat it in our sushi, salmon, yum, yum, yum, this nice fish. And if you go fishing to catch salmon, so you go salmon fishing. Okay? Dear listener, even if you don't go fishing, you can imagine that, oh, yeah. Okay, I'm into fishing. So why not? Because it's easier to talk about fishing as if you enjoyed it. Okay? There are some good spots. Spots? Like fishing spots, like places to catch fish, right?R: Yeah. And I think the full collocation is actually fishing spots.M: So guys, people with their rods or men with their rods because usually men go fishing. Have you ever seen girls? Like a group of girls. Like, hey, let's go fishing, girls.R: I have heard a theory about this. And the reason why it's usually men that go fishing is because apparently it's an excuse to escape their house and go and drink a lot while they're fishing. Apparently.M: Yeah.R: But that's just a rumour. I don't know if that's true, because I haven't been fishing in years.M: What are keepnets?R: Oh, keepnets are amazing. So, some people when they catch a fish, they throw it back in the water. But the risk of that is you catch the same fish twice. And that can be quite damaging to the fish, in addition to being a massive waste of time. So, instead, what you do is you have a net next to you but it's not a shallow net. It's a very deep net, it goes straight down. And when you... When you catch your fish, you put it in this net, and it can swim around in the free space, but it doesn't escape to the wider water. And that way, you can show people how many fish you can catch. And you also avoid damaging the fish, especially if you don't want to kill them. Maybe you're just angling for sport.M: Angling. So the word angling is a very nice word, which is a synonym. Kind of a synonym for fishing. Angling is the sport of catching fish. You see, so it's kind of a sport. And a person who does it is an angler.R: Yes.M: So like a person whose hobby is to catch fish. So it's kind of like professional. Angling. I'm an angler, you can say, oh, I used to be an amateur angler. Or yeah, there are many anglers there. So people who enjoy catching fish.",

      "M: Are you interested in robots?R: Well, I mean, you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who isn't these days. Machines and machine intelligence have taken over so many of the functions of our daily lives, it would be short-sighted not to have an interest, really.M: Would you like to have robots in your home?R: Yeah, why not? I love the idea of having a machine, you know, going around and doing all the chores that I wouldn't want to do. To be honest, who wouldn't want that? Unless they were sentient or sapient, of course, because that's kind of on par with slavery. But as they are right now, that would be a great idea.M: Are robots important?R: Well, that depends on the kind of world that you want to live in, really. Like if you want to work less and have more free time in order to do things because, well, your time has been freed up by machines, then they would be very important for this. Although you might have a job that would be threatened by having so many machines in your life. So that's something that you need to think about in advance.M: How can robots affect people's lives?R: It could go either way, frankly. You could wind up having more free time just by offloading the responsibility onto robots. Although, on the other hand, if your job was taken over by machines before the systems were in place to cope with this, or to address the problem, then you might wind up destitute. So it's important to keep these things in mind when we're talking about the advantages of robots.M: Would you like to drive a robot-operated car?R: I'm not sure about the phrasing of that question, to be honest with you. I mean, if it's a robot car, then who is driving? Me or the robot? But assuming you mean it's an autonomous vehicle that's driving itself, then yeah, assuming it's been safety tested.

Okay? So I'm into robotics.R: If you hate robots, too bad. Because that is what you're going to have to talk about.M: Rory's answer is really interesting. He kind of says like, well, you should be into robots, right? So you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn't like robots. So you would be hard-pressed to do something.R: Yes. That means it's difficult to avoid.M: Yeah. Could you give us another example with, I don't know, speaking English?R: Oh, God. Well, you'd be hard-pressed to find somebody who doesn't want to learn about English these days because it's a global language.M: And another synonym is it would be short-sighted not to take an interest in robots. For example, it would be short-sighted not to learn English. Which means...R: Well, if something is short-sighted, it just means that you're not thinking about the long-term future. So if you don't take an interest in learning English now, then it might affect your prospects later in life.M: Like short-sighted. Like my sight is short. I don't see there, I don't see anything there. So I'm... Can I say I'm short-sighted?R: You can, but that means that you need glasses.M: Ah, right. So I'm short-sighted, I need glasses, but it would be short-sighted not to take IELTS, right?R: Oh, is it an idiomatic expression for a high score? It is. Oh, the other thing I want to talk about is something that I didn't say. And the reason that I said it was I wanted to draw people's attention to it because I find that when I'm talking to students, they repeat the question in their answers. So the question was, are you interested in robots? And a student or a candidate might say, yes, I'm interested in robots because. Try not to do that. Because your job in the exam is to paraphrase the answer, not to repeat the words in your question. It's a missed opportunity to show off your vocabulary. So what I did instead was something we've talked about before, which is substitution. Yes. Well, is it substitution? Or is it ellipsis? Because I said, you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who isn't these days, who isn't interested in robots, but I just said who isn't. Because we already knew what the question is. So we can just say who isn't without repeating the phrase in the question.",

      "M: What's the best gift you've ever received?R: I can't choose between my phone and my laptop, really. Mostly because they both saved my bacon during the pandemic. Although if I had to make a choice, then probably my laptop, my phone could maybe have held out a little bit longer. But the laptop, the old laptop was falling to pieces. So this new one that I got was pretty essential for this period of time, even though we weren't preparing for it.M: Do you like to give expensive gifts?R: No, not really. And I don't really like getting them. I don't think the amount of money that you spend on a gift makes it more valuable or less valuable for the person getting it, it should surely be more about the connection between you and the other person. Also, there is a cost of living crisis in this country. And I'm very cheap.M: How often do you buy gifts for other people?R: Not as often as you might think, to be honest with you. I just do my close friends and family at Christmas and birthdays. And that's about it, really. Sometimes not even then because I don't believe in filling people's lives with meaningless stuff just because. Usually, there has to be an explicit purpose behind it. My close friends and family know that I love them though. I just don't express this with gifts.M: Have you ever given handmade gifts to others?R: Not since I was at school, I think. Oh, we used to make things for our parents all the time then. Aside from that, I can't really recall. Sorry.M: Have you ever received a gift to didn't like constantly?R: Constantly. Which is why I don't like getting gifts from people that aren't close to me. I think the most recent example is somebody got me a bottle of sparkling wine for my birthday. And I really appreciate the sentiment behind that, however, there is no way that I'm drinking something that isn't either champagne or bourbon because those are the only things that I, well, drink and can drink, really.M: Thank you, Rory!",

But come on, like can't you say like, oh, once I got a helicopter, or I got a trip to Cuba? Or you can say I got a car or a flat or once I got a cottage for my birthday. Like a cottage. Oh, come on, dear listener, it doesn't matter, but just be unique, you know? Just have fun.R: You do not have to be unique. You have to have high-level grammar and vocabulary for a high score. And I still think there were some pretty good grammar and vocabulary. Shall we focus on the grammar and vocabulary?M: Yes, go ahead.R: Fine.M: They both saved my bacon.R: So, if your bacon is saved, it just means it's like a way of saying they saved my life or they saved the day or they improved the situation when something happened. So here, they saved my bacon in the pandemic.M: I got a phone for my birthday, and it saved my bacon.R: It was a Christmas present, actually.",

So it makes it very difficult.M: How often do you ride a bicycle?R: Hardly ever these days, to be honest. I live in the middle of a city. So there's not much need to hop on a bike. If I ever live in the countryside again, though, it'll be a completely different story. Like I said, there's just not much need now.M: Did you have a bike when you were a child?R: Yeah, I remember.

You do get professional cyclists, though, but I don't think you really get amateur cyclists because so many people ride bikes. It's such a common thing that you wouldn't really get people trying to do it semi-professionally.M: Avid cyclists. So if you're into cycling, if you ride your bike every day, or if you just enjoy it, you can say I'm an avid cyclist, like I'm an enthusiastic cyclist. Also if you don't, just say it.R: Even if you don't, lie. It will be fine.M: Like do like cycling? Oh, yes, I'm an avid cyclist.R: Oh, yes, I'm a very avid cyclist. All the time, me, cycling. This was a difficult one for me actually because I hardly cycle at all or, well, I hardly ever cycle at all these days. Like I said, there was no need.M: If this is true about you, you can say I used to cycle. So in my childhood, I used to cycle. And then the second conditional, dear listener. So I would enjoy it if I lived in the countryside for example, or I would enjoy cycling if I lived in Amsterdam.R: Or I would enjoy it if I did it again. But I don't plan to.M: The second conditional.R: Is it the second conditional? Oh, amazing. Look at me using the conditionals.M: Yeah, there's traffic on the road. The preposition. There's too much traffic on the road. That's why I prefer cycling.R: Although, can we linger on the road for a moment because I discovered something the other day? One of my students was getting confused between the difference of in the road and on the road. So, if they're in the road, it's like they occupy the closed space of the road. But if they're on the road, if the traffic is on the road, then it's in contact with the surface. Both of them are correct. But it's a small difference in meaning.M: Rory, what about Scotland and where you live? Do people cycle there?R: People do. Yeah. It's ironic, actually. We were walking the dog the other day, and there was somebody cycling on a path that said, please do not cycle on this path. So yes, people are very keen on it, so keen that they will break the rules completely.M: And do people cycle to work?R: I used to know someone that did that. But I think these days, it's not a very common thing. Mostly because people live so far away from their workplaces, it's not, well, it's impractical. It's not practical. It's not feasible to do.",

Ooh, whenever I'm out with my friends or my family and we're shopping in the town, it's nice to stop by a coffee shop. like Starbucks, for example. Starbucks, pay me money.M: Do most people prefer tea or coffee today?R: Oh, at a guess I'd say coffee. It seems to have proliferated much further and wider than tea. I mean, you see more coffee shops than tea rooms, for example. So that's probably a good indication, isn't it? And there are more coffee-flavoured products as opposed to tea-flavoured products. At least it seems that way. I could be wrong.M: Are coffee and tea popular in your country?R: You would imagine so, since it seems like there's a coffee shop on every street corner, to be honest with you, and apart from two of the houses I've been in, have had supplies of it in every cupboard or even a jar on the kitchen counters.",

So that's my favourite drink. So, yeah. But usually people say just I prefer tea, I prefer coffee. Or this is my favourite drink. Like Champagne is my favourite drink, water with ice is my favourite drink. And I prefer latte. Do you say latte?R: I say good latte when I need a latte, which is almost never. What kind of latte do you have?M: So latte is like coffee and milk. Okay?R: Hold on a minute. So is cappuccino. So what's the difference?M: The difference is that in a latte. Yes? Latte?R: Latte.M: Yeah. So kind of like latte is more creamy. And we have less coffee in latte and more milk. But I, sometimes I do cappuccinos. Yeah.R: Nice. Same. And I also like a chai latte, which I think is a kind of tea that comes from India. I could be wrong. But there's also matcha, which is a replacement for caffeine... Or caffeinated drinks. At least, again, I think so.M: Caffeine, dear listener, okay? I need caffeine in my life, in my everywhere. So we pronounce it as caffeine. And I love the rush and focus you get from caffeine. So all this rush like...R: What is the rush?M: Rush like when you are in a rush, when you are in a hurry. But coffee gives you this, you know, like energy.R: Yes. So rush is like a surge of energy then, isn't it? Or it can be, as well as being in a hurry.M: Rory, but I thought tea is in your blood. What about all this tea culture in Great Britain?R: What about all this tea culture in Great Britain? Where are all the tea rooms? I only ever go to coffee shops. So I think coffee is definitely... Or it seems to have taken over. I don't know if that's a fact or not.M: Yes, dear listener, I've done some research on the internet. Okay? And one of the articles said that more coffee is sold than tea in the UK. Can you imagine that? So tea is becoming outdated. They say outdated, like... Like old fashioned. So even for English people.R: Those poor English people. It's a good thing that I'm not English.",

And the same is true for all the people around me. Although thinking about it now, most of the people I know are actually quite self-sufficient. So this isn't really something I have to do very often.M: Did your parents teach you how to help others?R; I don't think they said explicitly how to help people. Just that it was important. And the importance of asking if their help was wanted, and maybe what kind of help people would want rather than just leaping in and trying to save the day.M: Did your parents help you much when you were a child?R: Oh, loads. I think most people support their children as best they can. They gave us a place to live and a good standard of living. Again, all of that is something that parents should be doing, especially for their children when they are children. And now they often lend an ear when they want to listen to our woes or hear about our successes. Although that's not to do with helping people that last one.M: What have you done to help the elderly?R: I like going to see my older relatives. I think that's one of the best things that you can do.

But that's just off the top of my head. That's an idiom. We're working on an idioms course. But we only have a phrasal verbs course right now.M: Help people around you. So help like people around you and you can say like if it's asked for. So if my help is asked for, I'll help out. Okay? So passive voice. If it's asked for I'll help out.R: And is it a conditional sentence?M: It is, yes.R: Ooh, first conditional and passive voice, oh my god.M: Want some shopping done, which is a nice construction. So if my parents want something done, or is my parents want something fixed. Or they want some shopping done, I'll help out. So to have something done. Or I lend them a hand. And then you can joke around like, no, no, no, I don't need your hand, I want your leg. Yeah, like proper English humour. Self-sufficient, who is self-sufficient?R: People that can support themselves are self-sufficient. So most of my friends are very self-sufficient, which is, well, and rightly so. Most people should be. But that doesn't mean to say they don't need help from time to time. I mean, those bottles of champagne are not going to drink themselves.",

In primary school that is. Recorder is like a woodwind instrument. It looks like a flute, but you don't play it from the side, you play it from the front with your fingers. And then later on in high school, I had sort of passing encounters with the drums and various guitars, but that's about it, really.M: Which musical instrument do you like?R: I quite like the bass guitar and the flute, actually. I'm not sure if you would ever or how you would ever get them in combination. But I like those two in particular. Ooh, and I like the drums. Well, any percussion instrument, really. I just like the idea of establishing the beat. That's quite good for me.M: What instrument would you like to play?R: I used to really want to learn how to play the flutes. But it was, well, it was far too complex for me, basically. And I had other things going on at the time. So I think I'd settle for playing things like the guitar or the drums right now. Like I say, I had isolated encounters with them in high school, but that all went completely out the window. Well, essentially after high school because just other things were happening.M: How easy would it be to learn to play a musical instrument without a teacher?R: Well, for me? Next to impossible. I really need the support for things like this. However, some people are really good at just, well, picking up an instrument and playing along with their peers, or just by messing around with them. That's quite impressive.",
    discussion:
      "M: So first of all, musical instruments. Dear listener, and we play a musical instrument. Rory told us that I really struggle to coordinate my hands and feet. So when you coordinate your hands, so when you play, you have to coordinate, you know, hands and then you change things here, you coordinate this hand with this hand. So coordination. Okay?R: You have to move them together effectively. But I can't do that. And I think with a piano that's particularly important. What do you... I mean, you need your feet to play the piano. But what do you need them for? Maria, do you know? Like you press the steps but I don't know what they do.M: The steps? Oh, I have no idea. So if you play the piano, could you please tell us what you do with your feet while you play the piano, okay? And we say like play the piano. Right? So play the guitar. So play the ukulele. What about drums?R: Play the drums. Or, well, bang the drums. Yeah, it's important that it's the, though. And I think it's because it's a specific instrument that we have. We don't usually say I know how to play a ukulele, for example.M: And when do you use a? Like I want to learn to play a guitar?R: No, no, the most common collocation... Well, it's grammar. So it's colligation. The most common collocation is the, and the instrument. And I'm sure it's because it's a specific kind of instrument. We don't usually have a for one of many. And that would be like I don't want to play or I need to know how to play one of many ukuleles. And that doesn't sound right, we want to talk about the instrument as a whole, the concept.M: You can also say a couple of words about chords. So we play chords, okay? And these are called chords, right?R: And the chords is also a term for the musical notation as well, right? You see the chords in a line and it tells you where to put your fingers to play the notes.M: Right, and we change chords. And also you can say like I struggle to stretch my fingers because like to play chords, you need to sometimes, you know, do this. And this freaking... Like physically I can't do certain things. And it's like, you know, like on YouTube, they're sitting there nicely with a guitar. Like, oh, you want to learn to play the guitar. And then at home. You're just sitting there like, I have to do what? This finger goes where? And it's kind of like... occurred. The dinosaur. So yeah, it's difficult to stretch my fingers or sometimes your fingers have to be stretched in an unnatural way.R: They even have to be positioned in an unnatural way.M: In school, we used to play something or I used to have classes. And Rory mentioned another musical instrument, which is a recorder. A record is a type of a flute.R: Yeah. Well, I don't know, if it's a type of flute. It's definitely a type of woodwind instrument, which means that the movement of the wind is how the sound is produced, is a really simple explanation, because I have at least two friends who are into music and musical theatre. And I was talking to them about this yesterday. And I think my really simple explanations made their heads explode. So, Hagen Francis, I'm very sorry.

I mean, you can livestream things from the comfort of your own home for a fraction of the price without having to tolerate people's phones or them making inappropriate noises.M: Do you still like the same kind of movie you liked as a child?R: Of what?

And it's more about the quality of the scriptwriting and cinematography. I mean, I really like science fiction, for example, but I'm not about to sit through... I don't know, a mockbuster from a company like the Asylum, because their script writing and special effects are awful.

It's successful. So yeah, it's a blockbuster or it's a hit. The antonym would be it's a flop. No, this film is not successful, no one is watching it, and everybody hates it. So it's a flop. So it's either a hit or a flop, a blockbuster or like... A flop. Blockbusters or films come out. So when a new blockbuster comes out, I go to the cinema to watch it. And we go to the cinema. Okay? Or go to the movies, right? You see a film, you watch a film. Or you can also say like, see or watch a movie, right? Or we can say like, oh, I go to the movies. Or I go to the cinema.R: Yeah. So come out is like, well, the film is released.M: Yeah, the film is released or like what's on at the cinema? So I usually go to the cinema and see what's on. So what films do they have on? We can livestream things at home. What did you mean? To live stream something.R: Do you know? It's so funny, you've asked me that question. And I've used this phrase a lot. But I don't actually know what it means in detail. I think it means that you have an internet connection and you just pull the data from the internet. So it's like the film is playing. It's not recording. It's like a live experience of getting the data of the film.M: So you watch a film online. You live stream things at home. So, but the film is not live at the cinema. Cause, for example, we can watch performances at the theatre and they are live. So you just go there. You switch it on and it's going on live at the theatre. And you watch it at home. So this is like live streaming. Something which is going on live now, you watch it at home. So, it's not the same with movies, right?R: It could be. I think some events are live-streamed. I think there are concerts that get streamed at cinemas. So they're filmed and broadcast over the internet and people watch in the cinema. That used to be quite a popular thing. I don't know if it is now. I don't know how popular it ultimately became because I don't watch this kind of thing.M: Okay, so if you say like I livestream things, it means that something is going on live somewhere else and you watch it at home?R: Well, no, live streaming is to do with the internet being involved. A live event is just... It's happening now, in the moment.M: Okay. So can I say just I watch things online at home? Netflix is online at home?R: You could but why say that when you can say I livestream things?M: Ah, okay, okay. All right. Okay, dear listener? It doesn't mean that it's going on live. You just watch it online at home. Do we say like watch it on $? Or do I use $ to watch films?R: I don't think we can talk about specific companies because they're not paying us money yet.M: Yes, $, do get in touch. Okay?R: We need to bleep that too.M: The N-word, a fraction of the price. So it's just like little money? It's cheap?",

Chatter?R: No, I think chattering is more of a sound, to be honest with you. You hear it in the background, people chattering in the background. But that describes the kind of noise or your teeth chatter when you're cold. And you're... This is a common experience in Scotland and Russia at this time of year.M: Or I can say it, for example, like stop this chatter.R: Yes. But then you're referring to the noise, not anything specific, like the conversation. It's just the blathering.M: You can also say gossip. So gossip with your friends about other people.

We can catch up on things. So when you meet your friends, you chitchat with them. And you catch up on things. You catch up? Like you talk about what they had before, what's going on now.

Or apps.R: Not everything because I just looked in the library very quickly. And I found a copy of the 1973 version of Lord of the Rings. And inside is the paper version of what Middle Earth looks like. So there you go. That is a demonstration of what a paper map looks like.M: The Lord of the Rings, Rory. We're discussing maps.R: Yeah, The Lord of the Rings, it looks like that. But there's a map inside the book. I couldn't find a proper atlas. I'm sorry.M: Atlas, dear listener. What is an atlas? Atlas.R: It's a book with maps. There we go. But the Lord of the Rings is a novel with a map in it. You don't look very happy about Lord of the Rings.M: Yeah. Because we're talking about maps. Like as travelling. When you navigate.R: No, no, no. You can have maps everywhere. You can have maps anywhere you like. You can have it in a book for a story or you can have it for traveling in a real place.M: I use a map to check out how long it takes to get to a place, okay? Or you can say that I use a map to check out my route.R: Yes.M: Right? So route, the way. My way. Where to go.R: And you can check out how long it will take you to get to a place because, well, the online versions of maps often have an estimated time of arrival.M: I'm good at reading maps, or I'm good at what? Navigation? At navigating?R: Well, navigating doesn't always involve using a map, it involves following some kind of route, but the route could be in your head to following directions from a person or reading the map to find your way.M: I have a very good sense of direction. Okay? So if I tell you to go left, go right, go there, you are good at following directions. Right? So, oh, Rory, where's your house? It's kind of it's in Scotland, go left.R: It's in Scotland. That's enough.M: Directions. So you can say that I have a very good sense of direction. So I can just open a map and... Okay. And I know where to go. Right? Or I don't have a good sense of direction.R: Do you have a good sense of direction?M: Oh, yes. Yeah. Very good sense of direction. Sometimes I can mess it up. But still, generally, I'm quite good. And I remember things in the city, even in a new city, I can remember things. And then I just can find my way around. Okay? Yeah. Because I lived in... One month I lived in Bangkok, in Brussels, in Baku. You know, so I've been around, and I was quite good.",

I used to get up at ridiculous o'clock in the morning and take the metro and that was horrible.M: Will you use public transport more in the future?R: Well, probably the train assuming they're still running on time. I love going to a new city or, well, even just to a place like Glasgow or Edinburgh. You could just sit back and relax and watch the countryside go by.M: Are there any traffic problems in your area?R: Not that I'm aware of. Oh, wait, yes, actually, there's construction work going on at the moment. And we live, it's over the bridge from where we live. And we live right next to it. So that area where we live is jammed with cars right now and trucks packed with all the materials they need. So this vastly reduces the space, it's making it really difficult for people to park.

No, we don't say that.R: Well, you can have a way of transport. A way of transporting things.M: So you can say motorbikes, cars, aeroplanes, animals. Okay? Animals are a kind of transport. Horses.

I'm not sure if that counts.M: Which places are perfect for running?R: Well, we already mentioned the front. I think a lot of people go jogging in the streets, or at least that's where I see them.

It's just sort of useless, to be honest.M: Have you ever studied geography at school?R: Yeah. And it was extremely boring and the logic behind it wasn't very clear.

Geography wasn't taught well or it was taught well, I loved the teacher, and I was a fan of geography.

Oh my...M: The geography of our soul, dear listener. Kind of the outlines. We do search for the meaning of life, and who we are. Do you see how philosophical we can get here? And, dear listener, you can say that, like do you like geography? Yes, I prefer the geography of the soul. A basic grasp of geography. Rory, what is the basic grasp of geography?R: Well, that's just a simple understanding, like being able to know what a hill is or what a mountain is.

And then I started to make proper money. And one of the first things I bought was these RayBans. So, while I don't spend a lot of money on sunglasses now, I certainly did in the past.M: Do you give sunglasses as a gift?R: I mean people could, but so many things need to be considered... Like the style of the frame and the shape and colour of the lenses, whether they're polarized or not... I think even the shape of the bridge, to be honest, is something that has to be tailored to each person. I think it's better as a personal choice, but that's just my opinion.M: When do you never wear sunglasses?R: When I'm indoors or when it's cloudy, and there's no, sort of, fashion statement to be made by wearing them.

No, I don't really require eyewear because my vision is fine, and there's not enough sun in my country to justify it. There we go.M: Exactly. Also, dear listener, you use different brands.

I always wear either jeans or trousers. I wear either T-shirts or dresses. Okay? And Rory gave us jeans and shorts. Shorts like not trousers but short, shorts. A black shirt or a T-shirt and slip-ons. So what are slip-ons?R: Slip-ons are a kind of shoe. You just slip them on. You can see, there are no laces to tie. The laces are elasticated, which means that they stretch. With the shape of your foot or the size of your foot. And I find them much easier to put on than tying my shoes.M: Slip-ons are easy to put on. They're not flip-flops that you usually wear on the beach. Like slip-ons, like trainers, like it's easier to put them on. So the consistency, so Rory is consistent in his style. So he wears black T–shirts all the time. Consistently, okay? So the consistency is important. You can also say I always wear socks, underwear or hoodies, different hoodies. You know? Like with a thingy. Which are quite popular. So if you're a woman, you can say that I never wear men's clothes. If you're a man, you can say, well, I never wear women's clothes. And then you can say, I don't think I can pull off a dress. So pull off a dress. So I don't think I can wear a dress?R: Yes. So if you can pull something off in terms of clothes, then you talk about both taking off the clothes, but you also can use it to talk about wearing them successfully. So, for example, I couldn't pull off a dress because I don't have the legs for it. I'm not showing you my legs. This is not the kind of channel that we are. However, it's not something that lets me wear something like a dress successfully. Also, addresses are not for people like me.M: I don't think I can pull off a suit. Like a suit? Like a jacket, trousers, like a proper suit. Or I don't think I can pull off a short skirt, for example, right? So I don't think I can wear and look good in these clothes. It would probably look rather unhinged. Unhinged? Mentally ill?R: Well, I would prefer to say crazy. But yes, if you're unhinged, then you don't have a great grasp on reality. And perhaps you behave in an extremely eccentric or unusual way. So for example, if I was to show up to a recording wearing a dress, that would be rather unhinged.M: Sometimes I think my mother is a little bit unhinged. So she's a little bit crazy. Yeah? Can people be unhinged? Or like what?R: People can be unhinged, and usually unhinged is used to describe how people behave. So this is like really unhinged behaviour, or you're very unhinged today. This whole display of clothes for someone who does not wear lots of different kinds of clothes is a bit unhinged.M: Also, dear listener, you can throw in some topic-specific vocabulary. For example, I never wear neon colours. You know, like these bright, neon colours, like toxic green. I never wear skinny jeans, like very tight jeans, or I never wear too short skirts or dresses, short dresses. Chanel bags. No, I never wear Chanel bags or Gucci bags. Or I never wear leather jackets because, well, I don't enjoy genuine leather. So I don't wear leather jackets.",

Because my gut bacteria don't respond very well to that much sugar in me and I get all bloated and feel ill. But it's nice to have something sweet every now and then. And then abstain for another three months.M: Did you like cakes when you were a child?R: Yeah, a bit too much probably. I remember my grandmother would give us cakes almost every time we went to visit. I liked the icing in particular, which is basically just pure sugar. And that is not good if you had... Or if you're a child with poor impulse control, which I definitely was.M: Do you eat cakes or other sweet things after a meal?R: Well, as you might have guessed by now, not really. No. I think the closest thing is the bland protein аlapjack I have every day. Although I'm fine with that because I think it makes me appreciate the rare sweet things when I do have them. So it's not so bad.",

      "M: Right, dear listener, so we can make a cake, we can bake a cake. We can have a cake, we can eat a cake. Yum, yum, yum. We can have a homemade cake. Okay? For example. Or a slice of cake. A slice. A piece of cake, a slice of cake. Rory told us that he is useless at making cakes. I'm useless at baking cakes.R: I am.M: Useless. I'm not good.R: I can't bake. I mean, I could do it for myself. But if I baked for other people, I would be so worried I would poison them. So I just don't do this.M: So I'm not good at making cakes. I'm useless at baking cakes. When I do this, a cake turns out to be burnt. So my cakes turned out to be burnt. Turn out? They kind of, they happen.R: Well, my syrniki turned out burned. My cakes... I don't even want to imagine what that would be like. I've not made one in a very long time. So God only knows what would happen.M: You can say that once I was making a cake. A cheesecake. Once Rory was making syrniki. Syrniki is, well, they call it like Russian curd cheese pancakes. It's not a dessert.R: It's not? Oh, I thought it was. I'm sorry.M: No, it's not a desert.R: It just goes to show you, don't have to be factually correct when you're giving an answer to an IELTS question. You just have to make sure that you use the appropriate vocabulary. And if not, then I did say it's kind of like or it's a kind o. So it's not exactly what I said.M: Mayhem is a very good word. So every time I try to bake something, there is mayhem or I create mayhem.R: Yes, so mayhem is like, well, it's similar to chaos, or just a really unregulated and disorderly situation, which is exactly what would be the case if I did some baking because I don't have a clue what to do. Even if I followed the recipe book, it would just be a mess.M: Do some baking, okay? I did some baking when I was a child, for example. I sometimes have cakes. Rory, what did you say? You didn't say sometimes, but you said something else.R: What did I say? Oh, yeah. Every now and then.M: Every now and then. Like, do you have cakes? Every now and then. Like sometimes, not often, not always. Sometimes. If you don't, then you can speak about your gut bacteria. Gut... it's like inside your stomach. No, inside your belly, you have guts here. And Rory has some bacteria in his guts. And his bacteria don't respond well to sugar. To cakes. And Rory gets all bloated. So when you get bloated, you...R: You feel an expansion of your stomach. It's not very pleasant. It's not a nice feeling.M: Yeah, so kind of like... Like a balloon. I usually get bloated and ill after I eat a cake.R: Anything with sugar.",

They take up a little less memory.

A gamer is a person who is into gaming. Games. So you can talk about different gaming equipment. Like this is a controller. We also have gaming mice, headphones, you know, or a headset, you know, specifically designed to play games. Or you can have a gaming keyboard, you know, like a special gaming keyboard.

You go to some space, like the same with gaming I think. If you're into gaming, you have the whole room full of gaming equipment, not just only this. You know? Rory, you told us that you play games on the computer.

So play around is when you're kind of like crazy. Yeah? So I don't have time to play around. So I don't play video games. I'm not into gaming or I'm a gamer. Yeah? I'm crazy about video games. You can also play video games on your mobile phone, Rory. Did you know that? Like mobile versions of lots of games are there.R: I know that you can. Yeah, I play chess on my phone as well. I just realized there.M: Yeah. And did you know that mobile games have generated more profit than games on the computer?R: Well, that doesn't surprise me because lots of people have phones. But not many people have, well, the money for computers or different consoles, do they?M: So what do I say? Like, I usually play games on my phone. On my computer, on my phone.R: Yeah. Well, if it's most people, then we would say they play them on their phones.M: You can say like, well, sometimes I play video games to relax and unwind from my hectic life. Hectic - crazy. Unwind - to relax. So play games to unwind from the stress and hectic life. Oh, Rory is into strategy games, or what did you call them?",

So I swing this bag full of cats. And what will cats do? They... They will make horrible sounds. So when Rory sings, it's like someone is swinging a bag of cats.

Kinds of music or genres. Dear listener, also we call them styles of music. Rory told us about pop songs. So it's easier for me to remember the lyrics.

So I know the words, I know the lyrics, and I know the tune for a song.R: So a tune is a sound that, well, I can't think of another word. The tune is a sound that characterizes a piece of music.

    conversation:
      "M: Do you spend a lot of money?R: Well, I think that depends on what you mean by a lot, to be honest with you. I mean, for example, things like yoga and the gym have pretty fixed prices. So it's not really something you spend a lot of money on. Of course, the fact that I go there, when the average person does not means that I probably do spend a lot of money on it. So what I'm saying is, it's all relative, really.M: How do you save money?R: Well, right now, I don't save money, because I've just bought a house and I'm paying to have it renovated and making all the various repairs to it over the course of time. So that's proving to be a bit of a money pit right now. However, usually, when I save money, I have different accounts with different purposes. For example, I have an investment savings account or an ISA. And once the money is in that account, it just stays there and doesn't move. It's kind of like a psychological barrier for me. There's nothing to stop me from doing it apart from the thought of this money is there for saving.M: Did you save money when you were younger?R: Well, like a lot of kids, I had to piggy bank and various places to store money and save it up. And my parents tried to cultivate this idea of saving money for a rainy day. And getting money together and piling it up in order to buy more expensive things in the future that require you to save over time.M: Do parents give pocket money in your country?R: Well, they certainly used to give kids a few pounds. Pounds are the currency in my country. However, I'm not sure about nowadays. Everything is so expensive and kids are so excessively supervised, that probably it's not as popular as it used to be.M: Do you use payment apps or mobile payments?R: Yes, actually, once but it was by accident. Because I was holding my phone and my card in the same hand and I went to tap my card, but I tapped my phone instead. So it made the contactless payment with the phone. And it paid with money from an account that I didn't want to use. It wasn't a huge amount. So it wasn't really a big deal. But ever since then, I have never used payment apps for this exact reason.

And what proposition, Rory, do we use? Spend money...shoes, spent money...clothes.R: We spend money on shoes and spent money on clothes.M: Right, dear listener, please, please make sure you use this. I don't spend much money on clothes, okay? Or just I don't spend much money on anything. But I do spend a lot of money on IELTS Success Premium, dear listener. Yeah, you give us your money, and we give you a high IELTS score in return. Okay? It's a win-win situation. Rory goes to the gym and apparently, he does yoga. Rory, do you do yoga?R: What do you mean apparently? I definitely do yoga.M; So yoga classes have a fixed price. So the price is fixed. Okay? The price doesn't get more expensive, for example.R: Yes. Well, it doesn't seem to get more expensive. It's always been the same price that I've paid for it for the last several years. Whether that's true in other places, I'm not so sure. However, I hate these questions a lot. Do you spend a lot of money? Do you eat a lot of food? Because what is a lot? Like a lot for someone could be not so much for somebody else, which is why I answered it in the way I do. Because, you know, my life for some people might not look very expensive. And yet other people might think, oh, my God, he spends a lot of money on lots of different things.M: So it's all relative, dear listener. Relative?R: And if it's all relative, of course, that means that it's all defined in comparison to something else.M: If a person doesn't have much money, what can we say? Can I say I'm short of money, or I'm short for money?R: Short of money. I'm definitely short of money right now.M: Sometimes I'm short of money, okay? So I don't spend much, or I'm never short of money, I'm fine. Okay, I have some extra cash, some extra money to spend.R: However, I am definitely short of money because my house is a money pit, which is just another way of seeing a project that is very financially draining. So ever since I bought this place, I have been spending money on doing it up. For example, you may have noticed that my background has changed because I paid for blinds, which you would think is not expensive, but as it turns out, cost hundreds of pounds.M: So if something is a money pit, you just, you know, you pour money into it. Okay? So it just like asks you, oh, I need more money, I need more money. And you just like, you feed it more money. Feed, yeah? Okay, metaphorically.R: It's almost done, though. I have to hire a plumber to do a few things in the bathroom. And then, Dear God, please let it be finished. Just like, we're running out of things to fix, really. I hope we are, anyway.M: So you can say that I've just bought a flat, or I have just bought a house or I've bought, I don't know...R: A laptop, anything.

      "M: Who is your favourite celebrity in your country?R: I've never really thought about it, to be honest with you, since I don't particularly follow them. If I'm pushed on it, maybe, maybe James McAvoy, but I don't even know if he lives in my country anymore. He played Professor X in the latter X-Men movies.M: Do you want to be a celebrity?R: Oh, I think I'd sooner die, to be honest with you. Fame and fortune don't really seem to bring people much in the way of happiness or good living. Very few celebrities seem to be like well-grounded people or have a good relationship with reality. So I think I would rather be like reasonably well known for doing the right things rather than just famous for anything and have all of this money and power that doesn't actually improve my life in any way.M: Do you read news about celebrities?R: Outside of glancing at the occasional article and headline in the passing, no. I mean, I'd rather build up my life than, oh, focus on the trivialities of someone else's.M: Have you ever met celebrities or pop stars?R: I have indeed. I have met several comedians, journalists and singers. And I managed to get completely star-struck each time. So it's not really something that you get used to, I'm afraid. And I even have some autographed material from them, which makes for interesting keepsakes. I'm not sure they're worth much, but it's interesting to have.M: Do you believe that the news stories about famous people are true?R: I guess that depends on what is being covered and the publications covering it, when you think about it. I mean, for example, let's say it's someone's birthday in a reputable broadsheet, then I think the facts are pretty much beyond dispute there. Whereas if it's some kind of salacious gossip in some kind of tabloid, then I think nothing gets further from established truth than that. And I'm not going to invest much faith or interest in it.",

      "M: Hey, dear listener, this is your time to tell a story about how you met Beyonce, or how I met Leonardo DiCaprio or Messi. You can just lie, dear listener, and the examiner is going to be like, whoa, whoa, you really met Beyonce? Yeah, Rory didn't say anything like this. Well, okay.R: I said what their jobs were. I'm not gonna go around name-dropping. That's not how things work. Name dropping is by the way is when you mention the names of famous people in conversation in order to garner attention.M: You should know who is famous in your country. For example, Rory here mentioned James McAvoy and he's a Scottish actor. Okay? He starred in X-Men and also this movie - Split.R: But I don't know if James McAvoy is actually a celebrity in my country anymore. He's a celebrity from my country, but I think he actually lives in...M: In the States or, well, somewhere in the UK they say. Yeah, Google says like in the States or in the UK. But he grew up in Scotland, okay?R: Yeah.M: But he's famous in your country. So it's okay. So you should kind of give some names. Okay? So who is famous? Maybe like a writer, Beyonce, Paul McCartney, I don't know, Messi is famous everywhere. And a good way to start it, you say, oh, I've never really thought about this. I've never thought about this. Who is famous in my country? Me? Me? Rory?R: Well, it's not something I spend a great deal of time thinking about. And you could tell that to the examiner and they will probably understand because not everybody is interested in celebrities and following them. Speaking of which, if you follow celebrities, it doesn't mean you're physically like, they are walking and you are walking behind them. It just means that you follow the news about them and their lives.M: Do you want to be a celebrity or do you want to be famous? And Rory told us, I'd sooner die. So I would sooner die. Death is better than being a celebrity for Rory.R: You could say this to anything. If someone said, would you like to do blah, blah, blah? And if you really don't want to do it, then you just say, I think I'd sooner die.M: Yeah, for example, Rory, would you like to be a singer?R: I think I'd sooner die because that would... Well, I would die if I did it because I would die of embarrassment. So there we go. It's good grammar, though. For example, I think, Present Simple. I'd, I would and sooner for the comparative. And then the whole thing, I think I'd sooner die for the pronunciation. So it's pretty good. It's a good phrase to use, even though it's a bit dark.M: Yeah. And you can say, for example, like, I do want to be a writer. I'd sooner die. I'd rather be a singer. So I would rather be a singer. Again, like I prefer to be a singer. So I'd rather be famous, or I'd rather die. I'd rather be a teacher, I'd rather be a doctor. This is a nice one. And I'd rather be well known for the right reasons. So well known? Famous. For the right reasons. What did you mean for the right reasons?R: Well, well known is not the same as being famous, it's like in the celebrity way. Well-known is just like people know who you are. And if it's for the right reasons, then it's for doing good things. Helping people or having a good reputation, rather than being some, I don't know, notorious person who does all of these horrible things or behaves in a certain way. I don't really approve of that. So I don't just want to be a celebrity for the sake of being a celebrity. Being famous is the main focus. It's more about a few, well, a large number of people who know who you are, but they know you for doing one specific thing very well, or a few things that are really good.",

      "M: Do you collect anything?R: Well, I suppose you could say I collect tattoos since I have a lot. But more concretely, I've got this... Actually, I've got them with me. I've got this collection of plastic bands that I've picked up over the years. They come in quite handy as a teaching aid. And also they're nice reminders of the places I've been to over the years.M: Why do people like collecting things?R: Well, I guess it depends on what they're collecting. I mean, well, blue-chip art has serious monetary value. And some people just randomly hoover things up mindlessly. So there's not really any raison d'etre there. Some items are sold as collectables on the subject of raison d'etre. So that's like the reason, the whole reason that they're there is for people to collect them. And then some people collect things from their childhood. Well, it's nice because it's a nice reminder of that time in their life. So lots of different reasons.M: Is collecting a popular hobby in your country?R: I have absolutely no idea. I mean, I need to think about it. Yeah, my friends collect various bits and pieces of memorabilia, which are themed after various pop stars. But about people in general, I don't know. I haven't seen anything on the news or any articles about it, so I don't have a clue.M; What kind of items do people collect in your country?R: I think people used to collect things like china and stamps. But that's a bit stereotypical and cliche. And I have no idea how widespread this is. It's just something that you see or read about people doing in the media.M: Are there any things you have kept from your child?R: Oh, loads. We have a ton of old school reports and things that we made in class, like little ceramic bowls, for example. And what else? I think those are the main things. And, well, the reason why, like I said it's just a reminder of how things have changed since I was younger, or in the case of my school reports, how they haven't changed.",
    discussion:
      "M: So, dear listener, we are talking about collecting things, not accumulating stuff. If you have a flat full of shoes or jewellery, for example, you're not collecting, you're just hoarding. Okay? So like too many shoes, too many jewelry items. Hoarding and you are a hoarder. This is not good. Okay? But collecting is a purposeful activity. And the serious collector is knowledgeable about their chosen items. Items? Like things. So they organize them and they have a catalogue of stuff. Okay? So people usually collect what, Rory?R: Well, I think the common one that people talk about in my country is people collecting stamps, but I'm not sure how common it is anymore.M: So, dear listener, collecting could be a hobby. Rory collects tattoos. So he has a lot of tattoos all over his body. Rory, do you have any tattoos on your face?R: No, I don't have tattoos on my face because...M: Scotland freedom like no?R: No. First of all, I think that would be quite painful. At least if my ribcage... I had my ribcage tattooed and that was very painful. So I can only imagine what it would be like getting my face tattooed. Also, it would affect my employment prospects. So I'm not doing that.M: I have a collection of books. I have a collection of tattoos on my body. I have a collection of bands. Bands or bracelets. So, you know, like plastic, like stuff here. And Rory has a collection of plastic bracelets or bands. They are reminders. So these bracelets remind Rory of places he has been to. So you can say, okay, I have a collection of postcards. They are reminders of places I've visited. Present Perfect.R: I'm back. And you were talking about the bracelets. Here they are again, by the way. Obviously, in the real exam, you will not have bracelets, you cannot bring props with you. However, if you are wearing jewellery, Maria, can you point to it? Like if I had my band on?M: Yes.R: I could say like, oh, it's like this. Yeah. So you could actually use those in the exam as reminders of what to say if you're asked about the topic. Are there any kinds of verbs or vocabulary for talking about collecting things? And why is the answer yes? Because I used them.M: People can collect blue chip art. Blue chip art.R: And people that have listened to our part three premium episodes will know what this is because I already talked about it. Now here I am in the free part one talking about it too. So blue chip art, in a nutshell, has a very serious reputation and history behind it. And so it's got lots and lots of monetary value. That means it's worth a lot of money.M: And do we use an article? Like these items have a monetary value or just monetary value? Without any article.R: It depends if we're describing it in particular, like this piece of art has a high monetary value, so we're talking about it in more detail. But just to talk in general, I don't think we need it. It's got monetary value.M: Art costs money. So art, or like paintings have monetary value. Also, certain items, we call them items or things, have sentimental value. So like things from my childhood have sentimental value. You said that people can hoover things up.",

      "M: What's your favourite colour?R: I really like dark blue, kind of like the colour I'm wearing now, actually. And in fact, I like it so much, I had my bedroom painted dark blue. Specifically, it's called Oxford blue. And it's, well, at least I think it's quite calming, which is important for a bedroom.M: Are there any colours that have a special meaning in your culture?R: Well, many people wear their football team colours, for example. So they're like the same colour as the uniform the players wear. And this can sometimes have religious connotations. And our national colors, I think are pale blue and white, or yellow and red. So these colors also have some significance for people in my country when they represent themselves and their nation abroad.M: What colour of clothes do you wear?R: Uh, well, I usually wear the same colours all the time. So a dark shirt and jeans and white socks. I think I just like to keep it regular. However, obviously today I'm dressed quite differently because I've got this checked shirt on, even though it's still keeping the dark colour motif on the go. And I've added a little bit of colour with my bracelet as well.M: Are there any colours you dislike?R: I'm not a huge fan of acid or, what do you call it, fluorescent colours, yes. I mean, outside of the highlighter pens that you usually see them on. I just think they're a bit garish and over the top. And usually, they just clash with the colours around them. I personally prefer something a bit understated, kind of like the black that I'm wearing now, or the black and red tie that I have.M: What are the most popular colours in your country?R: Well, I think that will vary by region and season for some of the reasons that I already mentioned. I mean, for example, in the summer, there are the summer fashion trends. And I don't think they're different from many Western countries, to be honest with you. And there's also the winter fashion. And then on top of that, if you are living further north, you'll probably want to wear darker colours because they keep the heat in more effectively. Allegedly, this is just something that one of my teachers used to say.",

      "M: Dear listener, always remember that colours speak louder than words. Which means that colours do affect us, affect our mood, our, I don't know, everything.

So you'll have to find us on YouTube and have a look for yourself.M: Dark blue, okay? You can also call it Oxford blue, is this nice blue colour, which is very calming. It calms you down. Okay? So I really love Oxford blue or like dark blue. I had my bedroom painted dark blue. Or you can say I had my bathroom painted white. Okay? I had my flat painted red. Oh, a red room.R: Oh, God, if you had a red apartment or a red bedroom then you would probably go wild.M: Yeah, can you imagine?R: However, I should point out that Oxford blue is not the only kind of dark blue. There are other kinds as well. As I discovered when I was getting my house painted I was presented with about 3 million options. When I asked a very simple question, which was, can I just have dark blue, please? And I eventually decided on Oxford blue, because I just liked that name. And the tone seemed nice.M: You can also say I enjoy indigo. Indigo is the name of a colour which is kind of deep rich blue. So just Google Indigo, and take a look at the photos.R: Which shade though? There are like 300 of them.M: Oh, yeah, but like for the IELTS purposes, you can say, oh, yeah, I like Oxford blue, indigo. And also you can say like bluish. You know? It's like a pinkish-orange colour. Kind of, it's not white, but it's kind of like whitish, pinkish. Okay? And also, dear listener, did you know that blue is the most common colour around the world? So kind of like most people enjoy blue. Like, according to Google...R: So for once I'm fitting in with other people by liking dark blue. I'm gonna go and put on my dark blue shirt again then to fit in.M: So blue is the most common favourite colour. Okay? And purple is like the second one. Okay? So most people enjoy purple or blue. Let us know in the comments. What are your favourite colours? But don't be boring, dear listener. Don't go like, oh, yellow, orange. So kind of like indigo. Okay? Pinkish orange. Like salmon. All right? Turquoise. So don't go like white, blue, or green. So pick one name for like a nice color. Turquoise. And use it in your speaking test if they ask you questions about colours, okay? Colours could have a special meaning in your culture. Okay? So for example, colors could have a special meaning in your culture. For example, different colours can have a religious connotation, dear listener. So connotation meaning?R: It's the idea that... Well, it's the idea that people think of whenever they see a particular thing. So when people see a particular sequence of colours, they think of the football team, for example, this is in my country among certain groups of people. It's not true all the time.M: Some people wear the colours of their favourite football team. So specific colours have a like football connotation or a religious connotation. You can also talk about your national colours. National colours. The colours that you have on your flag. Different colours could have some significance, okay? Which is like another synonym of like meaning. So like red is significant in my culture, like it's important in my culture. And then you can give some examples. For example, in China, in my country, red means good fortune. For example, in Western cultures white is often associated with innocence and purity. But in the East white is associated with death. And you know what? Like Queen Victoria, you know, there was this beautiful Queen Victoria, in England.",

      "M: How do you feel when you are in crowded places?R: Well, assuming things are calm and people are pushing and shoving to get in and I've got elbow room, then it's not so bad. But if there are lots of people rammed into one space, then I can't stand it and I'd like to leave as soon as possible. I wouldn't say I have claustrophobia exactly. But it's just not something that I'm a big fan of.M: When was the last time you were in a crowded place?R: Oh, wow, I'd really have to think about that. It must have been the last time that I flew out of Paris, and everybody was kind of crammed into this boarding gate area, and there wasn't much wiggle room, to be honest with you. So that wasn't a very pleasant experience. However, that'll teach me for flying Ryanair.M: What places do you think are often crowded?R: Oh, you mean, aside from boarding gates? I suppose popular markets, like the ones in Istanbul, are pretty jam-packed, to be honest. And then in large cities, lots of pubs and clubs, especially as the weekend approaches, because I suppose everybody just wants to unwind and relax at that point, don't they?M: How often do you go to crowded places?R: Well, rarely, I'd say. They're only about 5 million people in my country. And I mean, outside of the major cities we're pretty spread out over a wide area. So there, there aren't many opportunities to go to crowded places. I think the only exception is when I go to, big events, like parties or nights out. But that's hardly ever.M: Do you like crowded places?R: Well, like I said before, it really depends on the context and the atmosphere, to be honest with you. I mean, if everyone's relaxed and chilled out, then I'm quite happy to rub along with all the people around me. However, if we're packed in there like sardines, and people are starting to get antsy and behaving in a way that's like that, then I'm not going to be terribly thrilled to be there. So like I say, it depends.",

So you're afraid of like... Too many people! And if I'm rammed into a crowded space, yeah? I'm rammed into a space?R: Yeah. So it's just like, well, if everyone is rammed in together, then it's all tightly packed, and you've been almost pushed in by the people who are in charge. So that makes it a bit difficult.M: So you can say I feel nervous when I'm rammed into a crowded space. Crowded or cramped, okay? Cramped space or a cramped room. Like not having enough space. Okay? So it's not about a crowd. But like a small space with no room. Like not enough space to move. For example, a cramped room or a cramped house. Okay? And also, Rory, you said, like, elbow room.R: Yes.M: Like, you know, our elbows. Yeah, parts of our arms, elbows. So there is no elbow room?R: Yeah. It occurred to me, mostly because I've been teaching idioms recently. And so this one was just sticking in my head. I wanted to mention to have elbow room or to have no elbow room. And that just means not enough room to move. So if you imagine people around you, you cannot even move your elbows like this.M: So you can say I feel really anxious or nervous if there is no elbow room. In a crowded place people usually push and what else do they do?R: Is that a collocation?M: I think so. Yeah, it's a fixed phrase.R: Pushing and shoving in a cramped space.M: So people are pushing and shoving. They're pushing you. Right? And they are shoving you. Is shoving the same as pushing?R: I feel like shoving is a much more deliberate and violent act that happens.",

      "M: What things are boring to you?R: Well, I really hate it when people just drone on and on in a conversation. Like especially if they're talking about something I've lost interest in, or never had any interest in to begin with. Or if they just won't give up their turn in the conversation. You know, when somebody just goes on and on and on and you just have to sit there and listen and wait for them to stop. Because if you did stop them, then you would be a bit rude.M: What do you do when you feel bored?R: Well, I'm trying to get better at living in the moment and just feeling my feelings, and dealing with them and coping with them as they come to me. But even I will admit that it's far too easy for me to just use my phone as a crutch. And whenever I get even a little bit bored, I just sit on my phone and open up a video on YouTube or a Reel on Instagram, and distract myself. It's just far too easy to open up a video and do that, rather than just deal with the emotion, to be honest with you.M: Do you think school is boring?R: Well, I just finished reading a book about this. And the author was saying that the two predominantly negative emotions in school are the sense of fear and a sense of boredom. And I happen to agree with that. Because when I was at school, I was frequently bored out of my mind. And when you think about it, that's not surprising that's such a common experience, because a lot of schooling is just someone else trying to get you to follow their plan, rather than you picking the plan that you want to have and want to follow up.M: Do you feel more bored now than when you were younger?R: God, I'm not sure how to measure that, really. I mean, on the one hand, I have more choices than I used to. And I have more control over those choices and when to take advantage of them. But on the other hand, there is not nearly as much novelty in discovering new things as there was. So I don't know. I think I'd have to think about it more really. I suppose the obvious answer is to say that I'm more bored or I was more bored in the past. Because, I mean, you're bound to be more bored when you have fewer things to do. But I have no idea really. Sorry, I can't give you a straight answer about that one. And I've just bored you to death with the answer.",

My classes - no. They're super serious, focused fun.R: Oh, well, mine are really good fun. So check out the link in the description and sign up.M: I can run out of things to do.

So there's no sugar in my kitchen.R: There are no fun things to do anymore.M: Yeah, like no more fun things to do, when I've run out of things to do, I usually get bored. I just have to sit and wait.R: Oh, is it another binomial? Fun and games, sit and wait. Oh, yes, it's almost like I've planned it out this way. So that I can encourage people to do this better.M: You can say that I'm completely bored when people... Or I feel completely bored when I have to sit and wait. Or you can say I get sick and tired. Sick and tired, you know? Like I'm tired of this. I'm bored. Also, can I say that I am disinterested in this topic?R: I mean, disinterest is more like a lack of feeling. Uninterested would be not to have an interest in something.M: So it's not the same as getting bored.R: No, no, they're, they're, I mean, they could be related, but they're not necessarily related.

And I don't really like that part of it at all.M: When did you start using social media?R: Well, probably when I was a teenager. And I was using sites like MySpace and, well, chat rooms on MSN. But I think I only really became a serious user in, what, the early 2020s? And that's when I started to use things like Instagram to make social media posts in order to promote things.M: Do you spend too much time on social media?R: Well, I mean, who decides what too much means? There are probably times when I'm on it, and I would be better off doing other things, or I couldn't be better off doing other things.

They are useful and efficient. So they are kind of like efficient. You write a message and it's sent right away. Okay? And your friend reads it. Like efficient. Yeah, chop, chop, chop. And we use social media to stay in touch with friends. So to stay in touch? To stay in contact, to kind of like to talk to them. So stay in touch with my friends, my relatives, and random strangers.R: You stay in touch with random strangers?M: Well, on social media, you know? Just like, you don't know this person, but kind of you talk.R: Oh yeah, there are lots of people like that. It's really weird now.M: What preposition should we use with WhatsApp or Telegram or Instagram?R: Well, it's on the internet. So it should be on WhatsApp or on Telegram. Not in.M: So I stay in touch with my friends on Telegram, on WhatsApp, on Instagram. What did you mean by \"bizarre sense of entitlement\"?R: Oh, I love that expression. I'm going to use it more, to be honest with you. So, well, a bizarre sense of entitlement just means it's an unusual feeling or right people think they have to do something. But it's not really normal. So in the case of social media, people have this bizarre sense of entitlement to your time, where if they send you a message, they expect a response immediately. This is not all people but they treat it like it's a conversation that they're having. So because they've sent you a message they expect one back, like you would have in a face-to-face conversation. But that's not how this works because, of course, people are busy. And they have things to do. And so they're not able to reply immediately. However, a lot of the time, sometimes people message each other, and they think they should get this reply, which is a very bizarre sense of entitlement.M: Entitlement is negative. So disapproving, okay? It's a feeling that you have the right to do or to have something you want without doing any work, okay? It's just like possessiveness, maybe.R: Yeah, it's funny though, because as a verb entitled just means something you have a right to. For example, like you're entitled to a lawyer in court in many countries. And that's not a negative thing, because you're defending yourself. So it's just this idea with the collocation, the bizarre sense of entitlement, or just a sense of entitlement, or even entitlement.M: So people on social media feel that they can get a hold of you. So they can just like reach you at any time during the day or night. And you have to respond, okay?R: Yeah.M: People can get a hold of you, like at any moment.R: It's very funny, especially when someone contacts you from the other side of the world. And they're like, why are you not replying to me? And the answer is usually, well, I'm unconscious because I'm asleep. So it's not always possible.M: I started using social media last year, when I was at school, or you can say that I used to use chat rooms. Rory mentioned stuff like MySpace and MSN.R: Did you have MySpace, Maria?M: No.",

    conversation:
      "M: How much time do you spend listening to music every day?R: I think that really depends on the day of the week, to be honest. So if it's a day where I'm walking back from the gym or jujitsu, then I'll listen to that instead of whatever noises you can hear in the street. Well, I mean, it certainly beats listening to those, that's for sure.M: What music do you dislike?R: Well, anything chaotic without a beat or a rhythm that I can follow. I think like, for me, some music is just, it's just random sounds that don't have any sense or regularity or logic to them. And the same goes for like really loud music. I just can't get into it. Although, that's probably more a comment about the volume than anything else, except for maybe death metal, which is supposed to be loud.M: What kinds of music are popular in your country?R: Well, in the free market that we have for that kind of thing, anything goes really. So I don't think there's like one genre of music that's in vogue more than any other, now that I think about it. Well, apart from pop music. And I think that's basically written to have an endless string of hits or to... For people to get really into and to listen to a lot.M: Do you ever listen to music at work?R: It depends on the task, I suppose. So when I'm marking or planning or writing, then I'll listen to some lo-fi hip hop or some baroque music, or, well, I'll have it on in the background. I wouldn't have anything with catchy lyrics or anything like that. More ambient music seems to help me concentrate. And I think that's true for a lot of people, to be honest. Otherwise, well, I'm also a teacher, and I think it would be difficult to teach a class and listen to music at the same time, wouldn't it?M: Is there an instrument you would like to learn to play?R: Not overly so, I'm kind of just happy to enjoy other people being talented in that area. I suppose if I had to pick one instrument, I would pick the drums, just because drummers always seem to have these really big arms. And so it looks like a really great workout. But then I'm picking it for the exercise and not so much for the music.",
    discussion:
      "M: Hey! Music! So we listen to music. Okay? Listen to.R: Oh, yes, that's so important. The number of times I hear people saying I listen music and I'm like, no, it's to, listen to music. Please, listen to music.M: Like number two. Number two. Yeah, music to. Listen to, listen to. It's kind of like one word, dear listener. Listen to. Listen to me, listen to music. You can say I listen to music if I'm out for a walk, for example. So if I'm walking, or if I'm out for a walk, I listen to music. Rory, you said it beats listening to something. Beats.R: Yeah. It's kind of a pun, though. Because music has a beat, which is... Well, it's similar to the rhythm or the thing that you can follow. I'm not very good with musical terminology. But here, if we say it beats listening to something else, what I mean to say is it's better than listening to doing the other thing. It's not always it beats, though. You could just say beats listening to and then whatever the sound is.M: So, for example, taking the bus beats walking, like beats, you know, like a fight. So it's better to walk than to take the bus sometimes.R: Well, it's like it's winning the fight as it were.M: Kind of like, yeah, it's more enjoyable. It's better. So you say like taking the bus beats walking, and here, it's in the same, kind of the same meaning. Right? So kind of like listening to music beats listening to street noises. Yeah?R: Yeah. Especially... Well, I think only if you're by yourself. If you listen to music when you're supposed to be walking with somebody, that's kind of rude.M: Give us another example with this beat.R: Lots of things. Like I think listening to the live version of music beats listening to the recorded version almost every time. It sounds smoother. I think so, anyway.M: I dislike certain music or I can't stand. Like... I hate. Yeah? And Rory doesn't like chaotic music. Like... Like this.R: I should say, Death Metal maybe does have some logic to it. But if it does, it's lost on me because I just don't like that kind of music. I'm sorry, death metal fans.M: So I dislike chaotic music without a beat. A beat is like tu, tu, tu, tu. Or a rhythm to follow. So when we listen to music, we follow a rhythm. How do you describe a rhythm?R: You follow the beat or you follow the rhythm. Like... Music words. Use the music vocabulary. But ask me what it means... It's got very technical in fact. Let's, let's use Google now. Google can be our friend.M: I dislike loud music. I dislike heavy metal, death metal. Yeah? Just like listening to our episode about singing. We give you lots of genres. So genres? All kinds of music.R: So, according to Google, the beat is like the basic element of the music. So, the rhythm is composed of different beatsM: Oh, okay.R: Well, the rhythm is composed of different sounds, to be honest with you. But a beat would be the kind of sound, I suppose. It's also composed of the silence, the use of the silence as well. Oh, I should say, the beat is also used to refer to, like what you follow, when you're listening to it. I'm bouncing my head up and down to the beat, for example, to the rhythm of the song.",

It's all marketing propaganda, and I can't be bothered with it.M: Is there much advertising in your country?R: Oh, far too much if you ask me.

      "M: Hey, thank you, Rory, for your answers! Advertising, dear listener. Such a, like, a typical IELTS speaking part one topic. So Rory, tell us what's going on with like, advertising adverts, ads, commercials?R: So broadly speaking, all of these things are the same. Commercials are something that's quite common in American English, but it's still correct for IELTS and ads or adverts or advertising is more common in British English. But we're all talking about the same thing, which is companies advertising or showing off their products in order to get people to buy them.M: And when I say commercials or adverts or ads I mean, all sorts of advertisements, right? On TV, on the radio or on billboards. So like any kind.R: Anything that tries to persuade you to do or to buy something is advertising.M: Yeah. What's the difference between advertising and advertisements?R: That's a good question, actually. As far as I'm aware, advertisement is the known that describes the individual things and advertising is just the concept as a whole. Is that right?M: Yes, absolutely. So when you mean individual ads, adverts or commercials, you can also say advertisements. But advertisements, this is a very long word. So usually people say ads, adverts, but advertising is this industry. Like biology, marketing, and advertising. Okay, dear listener? Yeah, and advertising is good. And also the examiner asks a question, like, Is there too much advertising in your country? Meaning, like, do you have too many adverts?R: And the answer is always yes if you're someone like me because I hate advertising. I mean, unless I'm doing it ironically for things that I make and sell but I don't like it in general.M: And we say that advertising is pretty boring. But if you say advertisements or adverts, oh, boring. And repetitive. Like advertising is repetitive. It repeats again and again when you watch your favourite film.R: Yeah. Especially if you're like me and I have a very narrow set of things that I watch on YouTube. So the algorithm only selects these very specific adverts for these specific products. And so I just end up seeing the same advert again and again and again, and it's very repetitive and monotonous and tedious. And I don't like it.M: Yeah, so repetitive, monotonous, all the same. And tedious. Tedious? The same as boring, dull. And also, advertising interrupts my viewing experience. So it's kind of like, stops my viewing experience, whether you watch it on TV or YouTube.R: You could just say it interrupts what I'm watching though. I was just trying to be fancy.M: Yeah. And what do you call these adverts? These annoying little adverts when they like... On the screen.R: Oh, pop-ups. I hate them.M: Right. Pop-ups or pop-up advertising or pop-up ads. Usually, on like, what? On YouTube? Yeah? So whatever you are reading.R: Well, they're everywhere now. To be honest, I think we even have one on our website. Or we did at one point.",

      "M: Yay! Nice and easy, dear listener. Huh, you see? So, here we can give shorter answers, like maybe one or two sentences, like from one to three sentences. So it's kind of, it's absolutely okay. But if you want to give more, to give longer answers, that's okay. The examiner could stop you and move to a new question, which is absolutely fine because the examiner controls the time. So when the examiner asks you do you work or are you a student? You should choose one topic. So I work or I'm a student. And then the examiner will proceed to ask you questions about your studies. In our next episode. Or about work. So here we are choosing one thing like work. You can say that both, I'm a student and I work but it's kind of, it's more difficult to talk about both of them. Yeah? So it's much easier to choose just one. And, Rory, what grammar structure have you used?R: What grammar structure did I use? Oh, yes. Is it Present Perfect Continuous?M: Oh, yes.R: I've been working as. So I have been working, I've been working as a teacher. I've been working as a dentist. So work as, work as a doctor, as a manager. So you started working, you are working and you will be working. So I've been working.R: And another thing to point out, you might be asked how long you've done your job for, or you might want to put it in your answer to this question. But please do not feel that you must give the exact time that you have been working there. Because in real life, nobody does this. So for me, I said, I've been working as a sales assistant for about a year now. Maybe it's 11 months. Maybe it's 13. I don't know. And really, I don't care. And neither does the examiner.M: Yeah, Rory, can you ask me this question?R: Yes. Do you work? Or are you a student?M: I've been working as a food blogger for about two years now.R: Have you?M: No, that's not true. So this is a good answer to this question. Alright? Then you can say, to be honest, to be honest with you, like a nice start, like what's the intonation here, Rory?R: What is the intonation, actually?M: I think it's rising, because like you want to be polite and nice. So to be honest, this job chose me. So I didn't choose it. Like the job chose me. It's just a job. You know? Like, I don't really like it particularly. So you know, like the job chose me. So to be honest, it chose me. Say it.R: To be honest, it chose me. An important thing to highlight here will be the use of it, instead of repeating the words \"this job\", because, or \"this kind of work\", because we don't want to repeat questions in our answers.M: And you can say like, I needed a job. So I need a job to pay the bills. So we pay the bills. Or we can say I have to pay the bills. So I just have to do it. It's just a job.R: It's just to pay the bills. It's not about principles or anything like that. I don't think you can afford to have principals if you're a sales assistant.M: Yeah. Or if you kind of work, I don't know, in a restaurant, I'm a waiter, I am, I don't know, like a manager. I don't plan on doing it forever, for example. Or even if you do plan to do it forever, you can just say it. And then an interesting answer to the question like, do you like it, do you like your job?R: Yeah. And so, it's alright. It just means it's okay. I don't love the job. And I don't hate it.",

Well, that's different for many people. For me, it looks like constant internet access. And being able to live in a warm house, a well-decorated house. I'm working on the well-decorated part.

I went through a phase of thinking I lost my keys all the time recently. But I think that's just a side effect of it being a new thing to keep an eye on after I bought the house I live in.M: What can we do to avoid losing things?R: I think that depends on what it is. In my house, everything has its place. So I always know where things are. And it would be pretty noticeable if they were missing. I used to keep my keys on a keychain that was attached to my belt. So I suppose people could do something similar with other small items. I don't need to, but they could.M: Why do some people lose things more often than others?R: I honestly have no idea. But then I'm speaking from the position of being a fairly organized person. So it's pretty easy for me to avoid losing my stuff. Maybe certain people have a lower working memory capacity. So things often slip their mind more easily. Memory is connected to biology. So it wouldn't surprise me if it was a genetic thing. Other people could be really busy and just not have the time to note down where everything is.M: What will you do if you find something lost by others?R: Well, obviously, if I know the person, then returning it to them is the natural choice. But if I don't know the owner, and it's something valuable, like a lot of money or a piece of jewellery, then the police station is probably the best place for it. Since at least in my country, people often check in there when they lose things. I suppose if it's like a random inexpensive thing, like a lighter than I might just hang on to it.

      "M: Do you like travelling?R: Well, you would think someone who has been all over the place as much as I have would enjoy it. But I think I'd prefer the idea of being in a place more than getting to it. Oh, unless you're including wandering around in the definition of travelling, which can be fun to do.M: How often do you go travelling?R: Not as often as I used to. I'm very much a homebody these days because I have a house to look after. I would like to go to a few more places, though. It's my dream to visit a place called Piran in Slovenia one day. It looks amazing, and Slovenes are great people, I'm told.M: Where do you usually go travelling?R: Good question. I think I spent a great deal of time poking about Europe like most Europeans do, but I wouldn't say I frequently go to any one spot in particular anymore.M: What do you enjoy about travelling?R: Well, when I was younger, I used to love the novelty of just being in a new place with new surroundings but now I'm older. I like the sense of freedom and adventure. I can go anywhere I like and do anything. And I love it.M: Scotland freedom!",
    discussion:
      "M: So dear listener, travelling. Okay? Do we like travelling? Maybe yes. Most people like travelling.R: I think most people like being on holiday. I don't know if they like the idea of travelling so much.M: But you know, like being on holiday isn't the same as travelling, because like travelling is kind of, I don't know like you move, you go from one place to another. You just go to South America and you travel there. You know? Alone or with friends.R: But is that the travelling that you enjoy or is that being with your friends?M: Well, I think both. You are with your friends and you travel.R: No, you must choose one.M: No, you are going to choose one at the end of this episode, but I can do whatever I want.R: Oh, okay.M: So dear listener, travelling and tourism are two different things. Okay? Are you a traveler or are you a tourist? Rory here gives us one huge sentence, which is, I wouldn't do that, but Rory is an educated super native speaker so he can do whatever he wants with his own language. English. That's why here we have a massive sentence from Rory. Yes, it is one sentence. But Rory made pauses. So for example, like before, somewhere in the middle of this massive sentence, he just made a pause and kind of started a new sentence.R: This is a good example of something called chunking, which native speakers do all the time to break up long sentences into understandable pieces of information.M: We use Present Perfect here. I've been all over the place, meaning I've visited many countries. I've travelled to many countries. I've been to many countries. And we can say also let them wander around. A phrasal verb. What does it mean?R: It just means to go around places with no fixed plan, just wandering, seeing what you can see.M: Yeah, I enjoy travelling. I enjoy wandering around. Like I go to Europe. I wander around different cities and different countries. Yeah? If you don't like travelling, you can say, oh, travelling, I can't be bothered. Like, no, I don't like it. Or you can say, I prefer a staycation, for example. What's a staycation, Rory?R: Is that when you just stay at home?M: Yeah, you stay at home but also kind of you explore the places in your country, I think. Yeah, it's kind of like you go somewhere near your home. So maybe if you go to the countryside, it's kind of like domestic tourism, okay? Or you visit places in your country. So kind of you stay in your country, but you can go to a different city or town. Also, if you don't like travelling, you can say, oh, I don't like travelling, or I hardly ever travel because I don't like splashing out on expensive hotels. Splash out on something. Rory, tell us what it means.",

There are these tiny things that stop the bed wheels from moving and damaging things, now that the bed is where it should be.M: Do you ever see things in shops and then buy them online?R: Sometimes.

I think the quality is a bit suspect.M: Do you think the popularity of online shops is changing your town or city centre?R: Oh, it's absolutely exploded since the pandemic. People order things in all the time, from takeaways to the regular weekly shop. It's sort of gutted the high street, which is a bit sad.

Sorry, am I taking the joke seriously again?M: Yeah, but sometimes you still need this, you know, like, like three numbers. And maybe you forget them. You don't remember them. So you kind of have to get up. Right, dear listener, so, how can we paraphrase shopping online or online shopping?R: Buying things online. Buying things on the internet or the net.M: On the internet. Yep. How often... Or we can say like, more often now than I used to. Please make sure you say used to. Like before I did that but not anymore. So like more often now than I used to. I order things online. I order decorations, and materials for the house online. I order materials to make repairs. Make repairs in your house. So a nice collocation. I order materials to make repairs online. And you can say that I order decorations for my house on Amazon. Yeah?R: How much are Amazon paying you to advertise?M: No, I'm interested in the preposition. Is it on or in or at Amazon?R: It's on Amazon.M: Yeah, Amazon people, just...R: Pay us money for advertising.M: We can say that Amazon is a marketplace or a marketplace shop. So I usually buy things on marketplace shops such as Amazon, for example, or I shop online using different marketplaces. You can also say that I shop directly, so I shop, I go shopping, and I shop directly on social media. And Rory, did you know that actually in the US, lots of people buy things on Instagram or TikTok, or just directly on social media?R: Yeah, I heard about this. There's a special kind of link that you can have. I briefly contemplated doing it myself.M: So but you don't do it?R: No, I didn't. I don't know why I don't do it. Probably because I don't produce enough products.M: If you don't remember, a good phrase to use is off the top of my head. Off the top of my head. It's kind of like, kind of, oh, I can't give you the answer now. But it's this.R: Well, if someone asks you randomly, like what the last thing you bought was, some people do this all the time. How are they supposed to remember? And in the exam, you don't have your phone. So off the top of my head, as near as I can remember, or as best I can remember. However, I am checking my phone now, and the last thing I bought was actually not the castors for the floor. It was in fact a very, very small bag to take with me to a music festival I'm going to.",

Or you can say like I usually sleep for a solid seven hours, or for a solid five hours. Careful, an article, a solid five hours, seven hours. But in reality, it's probably about like six hours, seven hours, seven hours and a half. What's this tossing and turning?R: That's just when you move around in your bed because you're trying to get comfortable or trying to relax. And it's always tossing and turning. It's not turning and tossing. It's a binomial.M: Yay. You toss and turn in your sleep. Or before you go to sleep, before kind of you fall asleep, you do tossing and turning?

But you definitely take a nap or have a nap. So I'm assuming that you have a siesta or take a siesta.M: So you can paraphrase the question. The examiner asks, do you sometimes sleep during the day and you say yes, sometimes I take a nap or I never take naps during the day. I've always felt really groggy. Groggy is like this drink? Grog? Groggy.R: I think what I mean is very tired, like even worse, tired and unable to focus. Like... That's groggy. There's a scientific explanation for that word.M: And Cambridge dictionary explanation is weak and unable to think clearly or walk correctly, usually because of tiredness or illness. For example, I felt a little bit groggy after the operation, for example. Or when I woke up, I felt a little groggy. And usually, I also feel this. Yeah, actually, I feel terribly groggy after I take a nap. So that's why I never take naps. It's like being dead on your feet. Nice Rory.R: Yeah. Like a zombie. It's not a nice feeling. This is something I try to avoid a great deal.M: So taking a nap during the day for me is like being dead on my feet. Okay? Like a zombie. Like I feel like a zombie after taking a nap. There you go, dear listener. We fall asleep or we can't get to sleep, is just when you're lying in your bed for hours and you can't fall asleep.

      "M: What do you like to do in your free time?R: I wouldn't say I had a hobby, really, unless my job teaching really counts. I do a lot of things in my free time, though. I like to read and write fiction and some short articles on teaching. And I do different sports like wild swimming, jujitsu and yoga.M: Do you need any special equipment for it or them?R: Well, nothing terribly out of the ordinary. I mean, to read, you need to have a book, clearly. Similarly, for swimming you need shorts, and yoga studio requires you to bring your own mat. But outside of this, I think it's pretty run-of-the-mill stuff. Nothing special. I think the most specialist equipment I need is the gi that I wear for jujitsu and a gi is like a kind of uniform that you have to wear for this martial art.M: Do you share your hobbies or activities with others?R: So for yoga, swimming and martial arts, I definitely need partners for those things, since it's safer, and well, even necessary for the development of some positions and moves and concepts. But reading and writing are pretty much solitary activities, and I just spend time doing them by myself.M: Did you have a hobby as a child?R: I mean, I used to collect these plastic models of various military crafts from around the world. That was quite fun. Other than that, not really, I only ever read or wrote and played video games or went out with my friends. That's the standard stuff that you do when you're a young person, really.M: What would you like to do with your free time in the future?R: Oh, I quite like the things I do already, to be honest. I recently got into rock climbing. So maybe when I'm back from Oxford, and I have more time I'll get into that even more.M: What are the most popular hobbies or pastimes in your country?R: Oh wow, that's a good question, actually. I think a lot of people go walking, running and jogging outdoors. Especially since we have a special law in our country that allows this to happen anywhere. I also think that outdoor activities in general are quite common since we have so much free space for use. So why not use it for those ends?",

But dear listener, again, don't use it in real life. And in IELTS it's better to use free time activities, leisure activities, or just like I do this in my free time. And then you say I do different sports like yoga, I do different sports like swimming, but Rory does wild swimming. Like a true Scottish person. Like... Freedom. Wild swimming.R: All it is is cold or open water swimming. Probably it's very popular elsewhere in the world too.M: Yeah. It's very boring to swim in a swimming pool. Like Rory does wild swimming. You know? In the open ocean.R: Well, it's also expensive. You have to pay to get into these things. Why would you pay to get into a swimming pool when you can go into the water for free?M: So Rory also does jiu-jitsu. So I do karate, I do martial arts. You know? All this like karate, jujitsu. Sometimes we do need special equipment. So special like devices or you can call it gear. Special gear? For example, if you enjoy diving, you need diving gear. So like an oxygen tank, a special suit. And Rory goes like nothing terribly out of the ordinary.R: Yeah. But that just means nothing unusual.M: Yeah, like I need a book to read, obviously. Swimming shorts to swim. And also, dear listener, to meditate, you do need specific equipment. Did you know that? So there's a special meditation pillow. And you can't meditate without it, dear listener.R: That sounds like some sort of late-stage capitalists ploy to make people buy stuff they don't need. That's ridiculous.M: Oh, it's called meditation cushion. There you go. Oh, take a look, take a look. Organic, cotton, chambray zafu meditation cushion. 40 pounds, Rory, four colours. Okay? Let's choose.R: Yes. I'm sure when the Buddhist monks who came up with the concept of mindfulness, where you know, investing all this time meditating and developing their minds. They were thinking, yes, we want this, meditation really needs some organic cotton. What a lot of...M: Dear listener, go to yogamatters.com. And take a look at these beautiful meditation cushions. Or you can get one for, or you can get some special... Oh, meditation kit for 140 pounds. Kit is like, you know, like...R: Yeah, it's a collection of objects needed to do something.

This means that everyone loves chocolate. And you kind of ask the examiner, but you're not actually asking. You're stating. Like doesn't everyone? And everyone does.

And in my case, I literally put my feet up on my exercise ball. So for me, it's not an idiom. It's like a physical action. It's a phrasal verb.M: Oh... According to Cambridge online dictionary, it is an idiom. Means to relax, especially by sitting with your feet supported above the ground. So you go home and put your feet up.R: But for me, I put my feet up by putting my feet up, like I put my feet up on the exercise ball. It's so comfortable.M: I work out from home, aside from sports, I read books, I watch TV, I cook, I sleep. And then, Rory, you used this... A dojo. What's a dojo?R: Oh, a dojo is where you do Jiu Jitsu or any kind of martial art.M: So you don't have it at home.R: Like a dojo is a, it's like a padded room, or at least it's got a padded floor, so if you fall on the ground, you don't knock yourself out when you get thrown around. So no, most people do not have this in their homes. If you have this in your home, you are a millionaire, so you probably will not be taking IELTS.M: Well, we don't know.

And even that like one of those visible aerials, which none of them do these days.M: How often do you use your mobile phone?R: Oh God, just about every waking moment of the day, to be honest. Unless I'm working or reading. Not to make or take calls though. Usually, it's just to post on social media or to listen to videos while I work out or do chores.M: Do you often use your mobile phone for texting or calls?R: Well, not nearly as much as I used to.

I can't even remember the last time I sent an SMS or placed a call.M: Will you buy a new one in the future?R: Oh, absolutely, yes, I've had this one since about 2019. And it needs a new screen and battery now since the first one is slightly cracked and the second thing doesn't last nearly as long as it should. But frankly, I'll be getting a new one within the year since it'll be faster and it will have more and better features, I hope. Maybe for my birthday if I'm lucky.M: How has your mobile phone changed your life?R: Oh God, I think it would be easier to list the ways that haven't changed, frankly. I have greater connectivity and access than I could ever have imagined. More than just with a laptop, for example, since the phone is more portable, I can do more through the various apps and I can manage things like my finances at the touch of a button.

So a phone by this company. The model number escapes me now. Like I don't remember the model. So you can say, oh, the name of the brand escapes me now or the model number escapes me now. I don't remember this.R: The model number is just the kind of phone that it is. For example, I have a Samsung S10 which is definitely five years old. I think the latest model is like a Samsung S24 Maybe. Just to date our episodes. And then of course with iPhones. The model number is just a number. I think we're on iPhone 15 though, aren't we?M: I am a Samsung person. I don't know what iPhones are all about. Yes, dear listener, Rory is an iPhone person.R: I am not an iPhone person at all. I am a Samsung person also. No, no, I used to be.M: Okay, hello! Oh, you changed.R: I thought you were an iPhone person.M: No, no. No way... You can comment on the size. My old phone my first phone looked like a brick. A brick is like a brick, this piece of rock.R: Yeah. Something used to build houses with. Most phones are not like this now, though. They're flat, or they look like a mirror, a Black Mirror.M: Every waking moment of the day means very often. And you can say, I use my phone, every waking moment of my day. So every second, I'm awake, I use my phone. All the time, nonstop. When I'm working, sleeping, having breakfast.R: Breathing. You can say, I take my calls, I text, I write messages. I post on social media, I watch videos, and I use my phone while I work out or do chores. What are chores? And the expression is to do chores.R: Chores are just the jobs that you have to do around the house. clean floors, clean the dishes, clean the windows. I don't know what other chores there are, to be honest, I have a cleaning lady that does everything else.M: And can I say like, ooh, I'm addicted to my mobile phone?R: Probably, yeah.M: Like what else can I say to mean that I use it very often?R: I can't leave it alone.",

But now I work from home, there's little need to have them on all the time. I like them when I'm out, though. They go up with just about anything.M: Would you buy T-shirts as souvenirs on holiday?R: I used to, but now, not really. I don't think it's very sustainable or economical, to be honest. Better to take nothing but photos and leave nothing but footprints.M: Do you like T-shirts with pictures and prints?R: When I was younger, I would often buy them. But again, not now. I think it makes me come across as a bit childish or silly, in my opinion. It's just not to my taste.

    discussion:
      "M: I wear t-shirts. I think everybody wears T-shirts. When I'm out with people. So I'm out, out of the house. I'm with people. I wear a T-shirt. Or I wear T-shirts. So careful with shirts. And then Rory uses some topic-specific vocabulary. What kind of clothes does he wear? Wear a vest or a singlet? So what's a singlet?R: A singlet is just a kind of vest, to be honest.M: So go to Google Images. A singlet. Like, you know, like I'm single. A singlet.R: Although, as it turns out, there are many kinds of singlet. There's one for wrestling, which obviously I don't wear, but there's also just the kind of vest, to be honest.M: Oh, okay. So but a singlet for working out. Yeah? To go to the gym.R: Yes. Well, I mean, I don't think it makes a difference, to be honest. I don't wear that to go to the gym. But you can if you like.M: Yeah. Or sometimes I wear a hoodie. But a hoodie is not a T-shirt.R: It is not. No. But that's what you wear over it.M: Yeah. So make sure you use two of these words, for example, like, oh, yeah, I usually wear a t-shirt or a vest or a singlet. And usually, I put a hoodie on. A hoodie. It's easier to throw on. So kind of a hoodie, it's easier to throw a hoodie on a t-shirt?R: It's easier to throw on a hoodie than a t-shirt.M: Ah, it's easier to put on a hoodie, rather than a t-shirt?R: I think so. Yeah. It's like looser. So you just put up your hands and it falls on you.M: So you don't wear a T-shirt under your hoodie?R: No, I wear a vest.M: Ah, okay. Okay. So, and the verbs we can use, I put on a T-shirt. I wear a T-shirt. I put on a T-shirt and then I put on a hoodie. Or like kind of it's easier to throw on. Throw on a hoodie. I wear casual clothes. So if you wear T-shirts and hoodies, these clothes are casual. And you can say that I don't get dressed up every day. Because I wear a hoodie and a T-shirt. And Rory used a tag question here. I don't need to get dressed up all the time, do I?R: Although, I think I might be pushing it a little bit if I say putting on a t-shirt is getting dressed up. But for me it is.M: What is dressed up?R: Dressed up is just making a good effort with your appearance, in my opinion. And I think putting on a T-shirt is making an effort. But other opinions are available.M: Dear listener, look at him. Yeah, so to get dressed up is to put on something nice. Like a lovely dress or a nice jacket. And for Rory wearing a simple t-shirt is getting dressed up. Oh, my God. Okay. But you can say like, okay, like, I don't need to get dressed up all the time, do I? Or like everybody wears t-shirts. Don't they? That was also nice. Tag questions. I love wearing T-shirts. Rory said I don't really have a problem with them. So I'm absolutely okay with T-shirts. I have them on all the time.",

    conversation:
      "M: What do you like most about your city?R: Oh, I mean, what's not to like, really. The cost of living is quite reasonable. We have good transport links to all the major cities in my country, and a variety of entertainment and sports venues for pretty much all tastes. All of it is within a stone's throw of the city centre, actually. So that's pretty good too.M: Is there anything you don't like about your town or city?R: Sometimes people here can be a bit much in terms of their attitude, like Dundee is the be-all and end-all of places, which is most certainly is not. We have our issues, and it would help if we focused on fixing them, rather than all the pomp that goes on sometimes. Also, it would be great if the local council would maintain the roads.M: Has your city changed much in recent years?R: Well, the waterfront area has just been through a major redevelopment, which is nice to see finished at last. And there's been a huge influx of foreign people in the universities, so the population is more diverse than ever. Aside from that, though, especially in the more deprived areas, not much has changed sadly.M: Do you expect to continue living in this town for a long time?R: I think so. I mean, I just bought a house here, and that was a hassle that I wouldn't like to repeat anytime soon. I might move to a bigger city in the future, but that's a long way off.M: What can be improved in the area where you live?R: Well, I wish people would keep the front gardens of the tenement blocks in better condition. Right now they're a bit overgrown and, well, one of them even has a bathtub in it, which is a bit unsightly when you compare it to these glorious old Victorian tenement buildings. And then you see this bathtub sitting there lonely in someone's garden. It's funny, but it should be removed, I think.",
    discussion:
      "M: It's just like people are too free in Scotland, dear listener. You see? That's why they have issues. They have structure. They need structure and discipline.R: I absolutely do not. We need roads that work properly.M: You see, dear listener? Like, Rory's answers are amazing. Like, what should be improved in the area where you live? Just remove this guy's bathtub from the garden. It's just, you know, beautiful little Scotland.R: Well, it's one bathtub, I should say, but it still stands out a little bit in our neighbourhood. I'm just like, why is it still here?M: There are no traffic problems. Migration doesn't exist, you know, like air is fresh. Everybody's happy. It's just like the bathtub.R: Well, we have a migrant population, the parking could definitely be improved, but I don't drive, so I wouldn't talk about this.M: So here, the examiner will ask questions about your city or hometown. So, dear listener, where do you live? Do you live in a city or a town? So a city is bigger than a town. Rory was talking about a city because he lives in Dundee, which is what, the fourth largest city...R: It's the fourth largest city in Scotland.M: Okay. So it's a city.R: It's also the best.M: No, no, it's not, Rory, it's not.R: It's the best city in Scotland. How would you know?M: Well, I know. I know. I've never been to Dundee. But I know. I've been to Glasgow, to Edinburgh. I think Dundee is pretty much, well, similar.R: No, no, it's not.M: It's a horrible thing to say. Okay. Anyway, I'm sure it's lovely.R: Thank you.M: So here you can say that the cost of living is pretty reasonable. So the prices are reasonable. They are not high, not low. They are okay. You can also say I like good transport links to all major cities, okay? So this is what I like about my place. So a good transportation system, or good transport links, like connections to all major cities, also a variety of entertainment venues. Venues means places. So a variety of fun venues. And sports venues, like gyms, swimming pools, for all tastes, okay? So for everybody. And then Rory uses an idiom. Within a stone's throw of the center. Rory, what does it mean?R: So if it's within a stone's throw, it's just very close.M: Could you give us another example with this about your city?R: Yes, there's a shop that's within a stone's throw of my house. There are several, actually.M: So within a stone's throw of the centre. Very close to the centre. And we say it rather fast. Rory, say it again. Like... Like this.R: Within a stone's or within a stone's throw of the city centre.",

It's nothing terribly drastic, though, at least in my opinion.M: Would you like to move to a different home in the future?R: God, I hope not. No, in the near future anyway.

I've been living in my flat for five years, seven years, and one year. It's actually brilliant. So Rory describes his apartment as brilliant. It's amazing, awesome, brilliant. And then more details.R: About why it is brilliant.M: It's on a busy street. Or it's on a street near the city centre. Or the street it's on. So my apartment is on the street near the city centre. I told you Rory is rich. He lives right in the city centre, dear listener.R: I live near the city centre. Not right in the middle.M: Yeah, but you do say like I live in the centre? I live in the centre, right?R: I live near the centre. I don't live in the centre. It's too busy, too loud.M: I have everything I need nearby. So nearby? Like near my house, near my flat. On top of that, kind of like what's more.R: Yeah.M: So you can say like, I have everything they need, on top of that, the transport system is good. And what's this... The tenement.R: The tenement is just another name for the block, or the apartment block. A tenement is a British thing, whereas a block is general or more American English. Although Americans might use a block to refer to the local area, it's usually like the square of apartments where they live as well.M: Like tenement is a large building divided into apartments, usually in a poor area of a city, Rory.

So animals are in the wild, flowers are in the wild. They are not in a shop, but in a forest, on a field. And Rory tells us that flowers brighten things up. They make our life more bright. Okay? Brighter. So they brighten things up. You should be ready to answer what your favourite flower is. So Rory told us about tulips. You can google tulips, but you can also say something like...R: Daffodils, roses.M: Daffodils. Lilies, lavender. This, you know, like this beautiful flower that has this smell. You can say daisies. So just go to Google Images and type in flower kinds and choose maybe three interesting names of flowers. I would go for daisies, lilies and lavender. Daffodils are also nice. But don't say that roses are my favourite flowers, because a rose is like a...R: Why not?M: No, because it's a usual word. Everybody knows a rose. But kind of, for example, a daffodil is already an interesting word. Oh, coronations, dear listener. Pink coronations. You should google it. So just remember two, or three interesting names of flowers. Okay? To impress the examiner with your vocabulary. Tulips have nice petals. So a petal is a part of a flower. So this, you know, a petal. A flower also has a stem. This stick. The stick is called a stem.R: So the petals open to attract the insects, and the stem supports the flower.M: Yeah, and where are tulips popular? In which country?R: Well, I think they're popular everywhere, but you hear about them in Holland.M: Yeah. The Netherlands, dear listener. Ooh... Like fields and fields of tulips.R: There's a very interesting story about that, I think. A long time ago, about 300 years or something, tulip bulbs were really popular, and they were traded as stock on the Dutch Stock Exchange, and they crashed the entire economy because people became over-invested in it, and, like, flooded the market. It's amazing. It almost destroyed their economy.",

I know it's not a great choice for the local economy, but the independent stores never really have what I'm looking for, usually.M: Have you ever worked in small businesses?R: Well, I mean, one could argue I work for one now with the podcast, but aside from that, I don't think so. I've only ever worked for larger local businesses like hotels and restaurants, but nothing like a tiny little shop.M: Have you ever thought about starting your own business?R: Well, I did, though this was sort of by accident with the podcast and the online classes. I like the freedom of action and the flexibility it gives me, despite the stress of organizing everything.M: And apart from that, what kind of small business would you like to have in the future, if you could?R: I wouldn't like to have one. I have my hands full already. However, if I were to open another small business, I think it would be something very simple, like a coffee shop or something like that. I say that's simple, it's probably much more complicated in real life.",
    discussion:
      "M: So dear listener, small businesses. First of all, what is a small business? Small businesses are types of corporations, or partnerships, which have a small number of employees, so workers. And less annual revenue. Annual? Like every year. Revenue? Like money. Than a regular-sized business or corporation. Yeah. So kind of like fewer people work for a small business, and they don't make as much money as McDonald's or Apple, for example. You can also go to our favourite website, investopedia.com. In the previous episodes we've been talking about this, and they have a nice article, what is a small business? Definition, characteristics. A beautiful article. So kind of like a small business is a company of relatively limited size. And it's measured by its revenue. Revenue? The amount of money and the number of employees. So for example, our podcast is a small business. Why, Rory?R: There are only maximum five people working on it, probably. But we should perhaps not talk about how much revenue we make.M: Well, we don't make as much money as McDonald's or Apple or Google. Also, McDonald's, Apple or Google, if you want to, you know, to be partners, feel free to contact us. You know? Yeah. And small businesses could be partnerships, for example. When like two or more people want to own a business together, okay? Or like, a limited partnership, or this Limited Liability Company, LLC can have like one or more owners. Corporations. And usually, there are different small businesses next to your house. And Rory said that the main street near my home is chock full of them. Rory, what is this chock full?R: Chock full just means there are lots of them. They fill every space.M: Could you give us another example with chock full? Sounds like chocolate.R: It does, doesn't it? Well, I suppose the small businesses are chock full of independently made goods. Because they're small businesses. They don't take things from chains, usually.M: Yeah, chock full means completely full. It's informal. And it means like, well, completely full. Like the room is chock full of books, so full of books. We can say independent businesses are still alive, or maybe independent businesses are disappearing where you live, but if they are doing fine, which verb do we use to mean that they are fine? They're successful?R: Well, if they're fine, they're alive, but if they're doing well or they're successful, then they are thriving.M: Yeah, small businesses are thriving in my town or are not thriving. And what can we say if small businesses are, you know, disappearing because of large corporations like Starbucks?R: Closing. Going out of business.M: Yeah, they are going out of business. They are closing down because of such sharks... Shark, you know, like this, hum, hum, hum, such sharks as Starbucks are expanding. Prefer doing things, buying from big companies, large corporations or in small businesses. And Rory told us that supermarkets or chains. Chains? Like a chain of supermarkets is preferable. They are more reliable. I can rely on them.R: Yeah, um, well, if they provide what you need consistently, then they're reliable. But if they do not do this, then they're unreliable.",

It seems like a massive waste of time.M: Do you compare prices when you shop?R: Well, sometimes I nip back and forth between some cosmetic shops when I'm looking at moisturizer. But other than that, I usually just pick the most convenient place to go, but I'm pretty low-maintenance, so most of what I buy is quite cheap anyway, and I don't have to search high and low for the best deals.M: Is it difficult for you to make choices when you shop?R: Not usually, but then I have pretty fixed requirements for clothes and things. Do they fit and are they inexpensive? I'm not about to spend hours traipsing around, trying to find the best shade to match my eyes or something like that.M: Do you think expensive products are always better than cheaper ones?R: Well, not always, but usually they are.

    discussion:
      "M: Hey, shopping and Rory are two different universes, dear listener. Are you into shopping? Well, I like shopping. You know?R: Have we talked about shopping before?M: Yes, IELTS, people tend to repeat the same topics over and over again. So dear listener, you can just go ahead and listen to our older episode about shopping. So dear listener, Rory's shopping works like this. Rory goes in, he gets the things he wants, and he gets out. Go in, get the things I want, get out. So if this is your, I don't know, like, this is what you do usually. Well, you can say, I'm a big fan of shopping. Go in, get the things I want, get out. Yay. Shopping is done. But do we always do this?R: I always do it. So then it's not a simple case, it's a case of, and then you describe what you're doing, or you could say it's a complicated case or a complicated process, but if it's a very simple process, then it's a simple case of, and then doing a few short actions, and you're done.M: You can say I'm not really thrilled about shopping, or I am thrilled about shopping. I love it, like I do love it. I'm really thrilled about shopping. Yay! If you are negative about shopping, then you can say, I'm not thrilled about being dragged around a million stores. Stores? Like shops. And if you are dragged... So kind of, I like, I drag you. I, I don't know, I...R: You take me there, whether I want to go or not. Have I ever been shopping with you?M: No, never. That's the reason, Rory.R: There is a reason for that.M: Yeah, so kind of if, for example, Rory and I go shopping together...R: Someone might die.M: Rory doesn't want to go, and I drag Rory to all these shops in a shopping centre. And sometimes we just window shop. When you do window shopping, or I window shop or I enjoy window shopping, you just look at the, you know, windows of a shop. You don't buy anything, but you just, you know, like you check out the windows. You look what they have. But if I window shop, do I go inside and check out the clothes and the things that they have?R: Well, the term comes from looking through the windows at the product. So really, no, but to be honest, just any process of looking at the product, but not buying it, but wondering about buying it, or what it would be like to have it, is window shopping. So you don't need a window-to-window shop, even though it seems like this.M: We sometimes compare prices. So when I shop or when I go shopping, I usually compare prices, or I don't. And Rory, you said, like sometimes I nip back and forth. Nip back and forth?R: Oh, it just means to move between places very quickly. Well, nip is a slang term or an idiom for moving quickly somewhere. Nip to the shops means just it's like pop to the shops. It just means to go somewhere very quickly in a short space of time. So if you nip back and forth, then you go between shops repeatedly to find the best prices or something else that requires going between places very quickly. It's very frustrating and tedious, and I don't like doing it.",

I'd take an umbrella in the morning if it rained, but I don't actually own one.M: What do you think the effects of climate change in recent years are?R: Well, we seem to be getting more extremes in temperature, until summers are hotter and winters are colder.

Go to our YouTube to enjoy our video about the weather. Cold or hot. Hot or cold. Rory doesn't mind either way. So if you are not bothered, if it doesn't matter, you can say I don't mind either way, like I love cold or hot weather. Doesn't matter to me.

Can I say I usually have a hot weather in my country?R: No, please don't say that. It's not a good idea.M: Dear listener, remember I have hot weather in my country. No article. Yes, you do say I have a good time. I have a nice book, but I usually have cold weather in my country. No a. All right? Or the weather in my country is usually cold. I prefer warmer weather. No article. We sometimes check the weather. The weather forecast it's called. I check up the weather forecast. And is the forecast usually accurate, Rory? Is it kind of like according to real life?R: Oh, well, in my country, it is. Most of the time. Obviously, it's difficult to be 100% accurate. No one is 100% accurate about anything.M: So you can say, I usually check up the weather when I go out for my walks.R: Or check the forecast.M: I check the weather forecast every day. Then you can use the second conditional. I would take an umbrella if it rained, but I don't own one. I don't have an umbrella. So Rory here is imagining. If I had an umbrella, I'd take it when it rains, but Rory doesn't have an umbrella.R: So I can't.",

I think I am convinced that breakfast should be breakfast. It must be a full meal, you know, like coffee, fried eggs, you know? Bacon, yum, yum, yum. Some, you know, fried tomatoes. A full English breakfast is for us for a reason, dear listener, okay? It's beautiful. What is a full Scottish breakfast? And how is it different from a full English breakfast?R: As far as I know, I think it's got haggis with it and black pudding, which is kind of a blood-based product. And I can just double-check because I've not had one in quite some time. Yes, it's got black pudding, haggis and scones made from potatoes and a Lorne sausage. But all of these are meat products which, or vegetable products, which come in a slightly different form in the English breakfast. So really it's the same thing.M: Delicious, dear listener. You can talk about something traditional in your country. What do people normally have for breakfast? What is a traditional breakfast in your country? And what do you call this thing that many people have for breakfast in Conan Doyle's novels, Sherlock Holmes had it for breakfast.R: What did he have for breakfast? I have no idea. Tea?

      "M: Rory, when did you start using the internet?R: I've never really thought about it before, but it must have been around the time I was 11 or 12, or around about that age when we bought our first computer and had it hooked up to the internet then. Not that I did much with it. I would usually just browse and chat to other people using that.M: How often do you go online?R: Probably just about every day now. Actually, I can't remember the last time I had an internet-free day, to be honest with you. We're so used to just looking at screens from dawn until dusk nowadays, or at least I am.M: How does the Internet influence people?R: Well, I'm not sure the internet itself does anything to influence people in a particular direction, but the things people put on there definitely do. They could encourage them to buy things through the fear of missing out, or incite them to take all kinds of actions by exposing them to, well, all kinds of incendiary content, really.M: Do you think you spent too much time online?R: I mean, how do you define too much? Am I on so much that it's a detriment to my health? I wouldn't say so. Although that is what an addict would say, I suppose. However, objectively speaking, I still manage to get all my jobs done for the day, and I'm not usually too distracted by things on there, so I think my time online is pretty reasonable, to be honest.M: What would you do without the Internet?R: Life would be turned completely upside down for me. I run my classes on there and communicate with my friends and family and students and colleagues. Like with email or just messaging apps. So without the internet to help me to do all of those things, I'd be pretty isolated, and I'd actually have a lot more work to do. It's actually quite scary to think about.",
    discussion:
      "M: So dear listener, the internet, the big monster and our saviour. Rory, do we usually say the internet, or can I use it without the?R: Well, you could, if it was used as an adjective, but if we're talking about the thing, then the internet. There is only one.M: Can I say I love internet?R: No.M: I love the internet.R: Yes. Do you love the internet?M: I love the internet. That's my life.R: With no qualms. Just the internet. We love you, internet. Thank you for making our lives easier!M: Thank you for making our life possible.R: I know...M: And, Rory, tell us. Which proposition do we usually use with the Internet? Is it in the internet, at, on?R: It is on the internet, online. On the internet. Websites on the internet. Look at the internet on your phone.M: So we go online and we look at the information on the internet, dear listener. It's always on. A very nice grammar structure Rory used. I've never really thought about it. When did you start using the internet? Like, come on...R: I don't know. Do people record these things?M: In their diary, yeah, like 1895.R: That's when I started using the internet.M: And then, dear listener, a far more advanced grammar structure, it must have been when I was 11. So I probably started using the internet when I was 11, but I'm not sure. But like, it's probable, probably, like, maybe, like, 80%. So Rory says it must have happened when I was 11. Okay?R: Yes.M: C2, band nine.R: I'm glad you picked up on that because must have been for logical deduction. Oh, I love it.M: Yeah, you can say that probably it was when I was 11, but that's boring, dear listener. Like it must have been when I was 11. Nice. And then Rory used a phrasal verb. To be hooked up to the internet.R: But we had it hooked up to the internet.M: Ooh, yeah.",

You just make do, don't you?M: What did you usually do together?R: It was quite a while ago, but off the top of my head, I think we were in the same reading groups, so we would read together and do projects and things like that. We were also responsible for keeping our desks in an orderly manner. Though, I'm not sure quite when how the teachers wanted it to go.M: Can students choose their desk mates in your country?R: Well, it must have changed a lot since I was younger, but I think we could when I was at school for some limited things like personal projects. And not for other things like mathematics work since we were at different levels. So that might not have worked too well. Students probably have much more choice these days, as far as I'm aware.M: Is it good for children to play with their classmates?R: Well, assuming they rub along nicely enough, I don't see why not. Play is one of the ways we bring skills together and develop them. So it makes sense to do this with people of a similar age and ability.M: Would you like to meet your classmates?R: What, now? I wouldn't mind seeing them again, but I won't be terribly cut up about it if I don't ever do. We're probably all very different people to how we were in school, so I doubt we'd have much in common these days, but just a random meeting in the street, I don't see why that would be a problem.",
    discussion:
      "M: Hey, dear listener, so classmates or desk mates! So what is a desk? A desk is like a table, but a special table...R: A table you sit at for work. No?M: Yes, like a table for work. Because at school, we don't have tables, we have desks. But at home, you can have a table, or you can have a desk. But a desk is usually like, you do some work at your desk. But a table is like, it's not for work. Right, Rory? Or can I work at the table?R: You could work at a table, but most people work at their desks.M: Yeah. Desks for studying, for working, tables for enjoying your life. Like a coffee table, and for some magazines, jewellery and nice cakes. Yum, yum, yum. And here we have like a deskmate. So who is a deskmate?R: I suppose that someone who sits next to you, that you share a big desk or a big table with at school.M: Exactly.R: It's a weird word.M: Yeah. Cambridge online dictionary doesn't know this word, but the Oxford Dictionary does know this word. A desk mate, a person whose seats or sat in the past next to you. Next to you? In a line with you. Yeah? Because usually we have a desk for two people. So my desk mate sat, in the past, 10 years ago, next to me in class, at school. In class. But desk mates and classmates, are they the same?R: I would consider them to be the same, especially in a discussion about school. However, the classmates might be people in the class in general, whereas your deskmates would be people who sit with you. So it's a type of classmate.M: Yeah. So dear listener, be careful with the verb sit. So sit down. And in the past, 15 years ago, my classmate sat next to me, or I sat next to Rory at school, in class. And we're talking about primary school. Like, well, primary. Like you go to school for the first time, and you go to primary school and then secondary school, but, Rory, these days, do schools have like single desks? What do you call them? A desk for one person.R: They might. I mean, the teacher definitely has a desk for themselves. So they might have a desk for one person or two. Whenever I've been in schools recently, they've had groups of people at desks.M: So like big desks, not for one person.R: Yeah.M: Okay, cool. And you say we got on reasonably well. I got on reasonably well with my desk mates or classmates. We had good relationships, okay? Reasonably well? Like it was okay, quite well. So to get on with people, have good relationships. You can say that it was quite a while ago. A while ago? Some time ago. I don't remember when. Do you remember your classmates, Rory? Do you remember like, sitting next to people?R: I remember them, but I don't remember them very vividly or in a lot of detail. So it's probably best to say this like, it was quite a while ago, but off the top of my head. So off the top of my head meaning what I can just about remember or just about think about. So not very well-thought-out ideas.",

      "M: Right, dear listener, coins. What a topic! Like when was the last time you held a coin in your hand, dear listener? Actually, today, I found a bag full of coins, and I was thinking, well, I should use them to buy maybe like an ice cream or some chewing gum, just, you know, to pay for everything with these coins, just to get rid of them. Yeah, dear listener, so coins. If you don't remember when you last had coins in your hand, well, this is for you to lie, to imagine, or just to tell the truth, like, I never use coins and explain why. It's also okay. So we say coins, and the paper money, we call them notes. Can I say bank notes?R: You could say bank notes. I think most people just call it notes these days or call them notes.M: Yeah. So paper money, notes. Coins are coins, like metal coins. And you can say, like, if I'm honest, like, come on, examiner, I want to be honest with you. I want to tell you the truth. So you say, if I'm honest, I can barely recall, I can barely remember the last time I used notes or coins. Barely? Like, oh, hardly like, I can't even remember. Okay? And dear listener, we pronounce coins. Rory, how do you say coins?R: Coins.M: Yeah, because... And maybe in your language, it's like coins. No, coins. Coins. Say it, say it now, dear listener, after me, coins, coins. So metal coins, and we use metal coins, and we don't use notes, for example. Use is the verb. And what's this verb? It's all been superseded.R: Oh, superseded just means it's been replaced by something better. Well, at least in theory, cashless payments that you make with your various cards or with your phone are better than carrying metal coins with you. So most people do that in my country. So it's been superseded.M: Supersede, dear listener. A verb. To replace something, especially something older or more old-fashioned with something new. What could be superseded?R: Well, landline. Landline telephones have been superseded by mobile phones, mostly.M: Yeah, or replaced, if you want. We say cashless payments, dear listener. So no notes, no coins, everything is, you know, online, we don't see the real money anymore, so cashless, no cash. And we also can say, pay by cash or use cashless payments. Make cashless payments. Rory, do you use your phone to make a payment? Just like, you know, you touch it like...R: I don't but I'm seriously thinking that I might start doing that.M: And what do you call it in English when you go like... And money is gone.R: Oh, it's just tapping your phone. Contactless. Make a contactless payment.M: Yeah. Contactless payment, dear listener. We don't even need cards anymore. We carry coins. So I carry coins. Well, I don't carry. I kind of have them with me. Or I can have coins in my... Where? Where do I usually keep coins?R: In your wallets if you're a man, and in your purse if you're a lady.M: Exactly. Yeah, maybe in your pocket. And no, we usually don't. Well maybe, do you, dear listener, do you carry coins with you? When I'm on holiday, yeah, when I change money.

      "M: What can you see from the windows where you live?R: Well, currently, not a great deal, since I'm living on the ground floor of an apartment block that faces into the courtyard, so there are a few trees and some rather dismal-looking play equipment, which are usually cast in shadows by the other blocks. Usually, it's less depressing, since my actual home is on the second floor of an apartment block near the sea. So it overlooks part of the town, and you can see the fields in the distance. That's much more picturesque.M: Is there good scenery in your hometown?R: I would say so, since we have the hills behind the city and it faces the sea and opposing riverbanks, so there's a great variety of things to see, from the fields on the other banks to the more rugged terrain of the hills. And then we've got the calmer coastal areas. And since we get all kinds of weather there, you can see it all on bright sunny days or shrouded in mist when it's foggier, which changes the atmosphere as well.M: Do you like to take photos of good* scenery?R: I wouldn't say it's a hobby for me, but when I experience a great view, then I turn my camera on it and get a few shots. My desktop background is actually a panoramic shot of a mountain range I took... Well, it's a mountain range out of forest. I took this picture in Northern Cyprus. You'd never know it was taken by an amateur, though, it looks pretty good and very professional.M: Do you like to stay in hotels with scenic views?R: Well, I suppose, while there is something to be said for waking up and flinging open the curtains to see something spectacular, like a cityscape, it's not something I make a point of asking for. When it comes down to it, for me, a hotel is just a place to stay and sleep while you visit somewhere, the real value is getting out and about in the scenery, not just looking at it.",
    discussion:
      "M: Hey! So good views, dear listener. So the key words here for us is, first of all, scenery. Okay? Scenery. The general appearance of the natural environment, especially when it's beautiful. Scenery. We say beautiful scenery. Like in the mountains, we have beautiful or breathtaking or spectacular scenery. Like scenery? Mountains, lakes, beautiful nature, okay? We admire the scenery. Rory, what's the adjective?R: Oh, is it scenic?M: Yeah, C1, super advanced, dear listener. Scenic. Scenic views or a scenic drive from home to work. Or for example, this area has scenic beauty, all right? So that's why here, the examiner can ask you questions about good views, scenery, beautiful scenery and scenic views. What can you see from the windows? From your windows. Nothing.R: Or not a great deal.M: Yeah, not a great deal. So not much. You can say I'm living on the first floor, on the ground floor, so I don't have anything, or I can see a few trees. What is it, dismal... Dismal looking?R: Yeah, if something is dismal looking, then it doesn't look great. It's not very bright and cheerful.M: Yeah, kind of sad, without hope. Like dismal. Dismal weather, bad weather. You can say I see other apartment blocks or other buildings. The view could be depressing, or it's not that depressing. Or I have a spectacular view. Rory, what preposition should we use? I have a view of, over, on, at?R: Oh, wow. Well, you have a view of a thing, but then you have a view over something or overlooking something, because you can see the top of it. So the preposition that you choose will determine the direction and how much you can see.M: For example, can I say I have a view over the forest?R: I think overlooking the forest would be better.M: I have a view overlooking the forest. What if I see other buildings from my windows? What do I say?R: Okay, then I have a view of other buildings from my windows.M: What about a shop? I see some shops from my windows.R: Well, what, I can see some shops, I have a view of some shops from my windows.M: Yeah, I have a view of some shops. Okay? And the verb is \"overlook\". So what do we say? My windows overlook the sea?R: Yeah, I think so.M: Like my windows overlook some shops. Would it be okay?R: I don't see any problems with that, no.M: And you can use the adjective picturesque. Like really beautiful, picturesque view. But if you don't see much, you can say, just okay, my windows overlook the playground, for example, or I have a view of children's playground. Or just lie, dear listener, lie. Imagine you live by the sea. And say, oh, my windows overlook the sea and the beautiful forest by the sea. Then the question is about scenery. So is there good scenery? And scenery is singular. So scenery is beautiful, or the scenery is beautiful. There is beautiful scenery in my hometown, and Rory lives in the middle of Scotland, right? So he has mountains and the hills and the sea, river banks. So he does have beautiful scenery. You can also say spectacular scenery, breathtaking scenery. If you live in a small city, you can just lie. Oh, yes, I have... Can I say I have a beautiful scenery?",

Sometimes I wear different scents of aftershave or eau de toilette from a certain brand. But aside from that, it's usually just a clean smell of my deodorant that I have on.M: How much do you spend on perfume?R: Not a lot, I think. Maybe less than 100 pounds a year.

Sometimes I put it on my wrists. A friend once said that that was a good idea for spreading it around. But I have no idea if that's true or not.M: Do you give perfume as a gift?R: I do, well, very regularly, actually.

It's all about things you spray on yourself to make yourself smell nice.M: Yeah, dear listener, so usually perfume for women, for men, deodorant or aftershave. And an aftershave could be a kind of perfume.R: I certainly hope so, because I pay a lot for it.M: No, but like aftershave is like something, which like you shave your face, and then you put this aftershave, it could be a foam, this white thingy, maybe, or kind of the spray. Aftershave on your face, right? You don't spray it on your neck.R: I think one thing you're describing is shaving foam. That's what you use before you shave.

Some brands use this kind of mechanism instead.M: True. So we can spray the perfume. Like... Or we can just put the perfume on our skin.R: Yes.M: You can say that I have my preferences in terms of fragrances. Fragrance is a nice synonym to smell. Oh, I like this fragrance. I like this smell.R: What's the difference between a smell and a fragrance?M: Well, a fragrance is C2 word. So band nine word. And a fragrance is always good, dear listener. A sweet or pleasant smell. A smell could be bad. Oh, it smells bad. Like a bad smell. But fragrance is always good, like a beautiful fragrance of roses. Yeah. And also a fragrance could be a kind of perfume. So a new fragrance for men. So a new perfume, a new aftershave for men, right? So it's kind of like perfume, or a fragrance, this liquid that we put on our bodies for us to smell pleasant. So you can say that's like, ooh, I have my preferences in terms of fragrances. I prefer different fragrances. What kinds of perfume? So there are different kinds of perfume, but like...R: Apparently.M: What is it like? Kinds? Like categories of perfume?

But usually, dear listener, like no article, okay, I enjoy Teamwork. Teamwork is very important in our life, or I just dislike teamwork. Rory used a very interesting expression, many hands make light work.R: Yes, but that just means, if there are lots of people working on something, something complex, then it will work or be effective.M: Hmm, it's a kind of a proverb.R: It is.M: Not even an idiom. Yeah. Like when people can do things more quickly and easily together. It's a huge project, but many hands make light work. Light work? Like easy work.R: Is that what that means?M: Well, according to Merriam-Webster, this idiom actually used to say that people can do things more quickly and easily when they work together.R: Yeah, but when it's make light work, it means that the work is not heavy. Is that what it means?M: Yeah, like say they do it more easily. So yeah.R: Oh, my God. I thought it meant, um, it makes, it's like an idiom. If lots of people are working on something, then the lights are on.M: No, Rory. Come on.",

    conversation:
      "M: Are the roads in the area where you live busy?R: Well, not in the immediate area. I wouldn't say. So it's quite a narrow set of roads, or at least a narrow set of streets, so not many cars can use them at any one time anyway, even the main roads up and down the road from my house are usually reasonably clear.M: How do people cross the road in the city where you live?R: Oh, wow. Well, in as many ways as there are people, frankly, usually we have traffic lights that can be operated by pedestrians, but sometimes people just cross the road where they please, and you can only hope they do that after looking both ways. Thank heavens, the traffic isn't that bad. Otherwise, there could be a lot of accidents.M: What's the condition of the roads in your city?R: It's not that bad where I live now. I think the worst things are people parking on pavements or the occasional pothole, but I live near the centre, so that's to be expected. Further afield, it's a different story. There are numerous potholes and cracks in the asphalt, despite the endless roadworks, and some roads are so narrow that only one car can move on them at any one time.M: Do you think the roads in your city need improvement?R: Well, I wouldn't say it's so bad in the city proper, but the infrastructure in the suburbs and the outskirts could definitely use some work. It's so obvious they haven't been built to last, and repair efforts seem so poorly planned out. It's ridiculous.",
    discussion:
      "M: Hey! Roads, dear listener! And traffic. We say that the roads are busy. You know, you are busy with work, and also the roads are busy with their work, which is traffic.R: They are packed.M: The roads are packed. They are busy. This means that there are a lot of cars. I usually have heavy traffic, or there is heavy traffic on the road. We have the main road and little streets, like narrow streets. The main road is the most important road. Usually is the biggest, the widest road. So you can say that, okay, the main road is very busy all the time, or not so busy. Or you can say that the main roads are usually reasonably clear. Rory lives in a city in Scotland, but if you live in a big place like, I don't know, the capital of your country, you can say that the roads are super busy every day, and we have very heavy traffic. We have a lot of traffic jams, and the traffic is really intense. What else can we say? What other synonyms do we have for like, the roads are busy, heavy traffic?R: Oh, they're jammed. They're gridlocked.M: There are a lot of traffic jams. The roads are packed. The roads are gridlocked. So I say like the roads are gridlocked, right? Or the city is gridlocked.R: Well, it could be both, really. The fact is that nothing is moving.M: Gridlock? A situation where roads in your town become blocked. So everything becomes so blocked by cars that it is impossible for any traffic to move. People cross the road. All right? How do they usually do it? There are traffic lights.R: Yes.M: And pedestrians. So people who cross the road are called pedestrians. And pedestrians just push the button, and traffic lights, you know, regulate this movement. And there are like buttons, right? But you may not have buttons. But very often, in some places we have. Kind of you are about to cross the road, and then you like push a button, and then like... And then, like, off you go, green light. And what do you call this crossing? Is it like a zebra crossing? Is it crossing?R: Oh, God. They all have different names. You have pelican crossings and all kinds of things like that. I just call them traffic lights that can be operated by pedestrians. I used to know the differences, but now it's lost on me.M: The most common crossing is zebra crossing, or you can call it pedestrian crossing, is where you have a road and these white lines like zebra. Okay? So zebra crossing, pedestrian crossing, where you cross the road. And what do you call this, when it's not on the road, but you have to go down to cross the road?R: It could be an underpass, I suppose.M: Oh, yeah. Underground passage.R: Yeah. Do you know? It's funny, we don't really have those in this country so much. I've only seen one in my local area, and it goes underneath the railway lines.M: Okay, so an underpass, dear listener. A road or path that goes under something such as a busy road, allowing vehicles or people to go from one side to the other. So, yeah, an underpass is another way to cross the road when you go down. So there are underpasses and there are zebra crossings, okay? Yeah. But what about London? London is full of underpasses. No?R: Is it? I don't know. It's got underground stations, for sure.M: Yeah, underground stations, yeah, like the tube. But how do people cross the road?R: I think they just use the normal ways that we were talking about, really.M: Zebra crossing.R: Yeah.",

And if it's something more complex, like a leak in the plumbing, then it's probably time to call in an expert.M: What kinds of help do you often ask for?R: Well, anything and everything connected to home maintenance. I know nothing about DIY or electrical work, so I always need a hand with that when something goes wrong.M: Why are teachers always willing to help students?R: Probably because it's their job? I mean, the entire point of being a teacher is someone who supports and challenges appropriately. So if they aren't doing that well, then what are they doing?M: When was the last time you asked for help?R: Well, currently I'm in the middle of trying to get a new shower installed in the house, which has been a bit of a pain. I must have called about a million different numbers for advice, but none have been forthcoming so far, unfortunately. If you're looking for a specific time, then probably yesterday, I suppose.",
    discussion:
      "M: So dear listener, asking for help. We ask for help. That's it. What other synonyms? Like I can ask for help, I can...R: Ask someone to give you a hand. Or ask for a hand with something.M: Right. Yeah. Give me a hand with my homework. Help me with my homework. Ask people to give me a hand with something.R: Or help you out with something. But that's still got the word help in it.M: Yeah, help me out. I usually ask people to help me out with IELTS writing essays. So you can say that if it's something I can fix by myself if I can fix it myself if I can do it myself, I just do it alone. But if it's something more complex, more complicated...R: Then it's time to call in an expert. So if we call someone in, they're helping us out.M: And you physically call somebody? Like on your phone.R: It could be. Yeah. Or even just any process by which you get them to the house is calling them in. So it could be an email or a message.M: Yeah. And as an example, you can talk about something that breaks in your house. Like a leak. A leak is usually in your bathroom when you have water coming out from your pipes. Yeah? From your toilet. Something like there's water coming from somewhere in your house. There is a leak. And you can say that if there is a leak in my house, I usually call in an expert. I usually call an expert to fix this. And plumbing. What is plumbing?R: So broadly speaking, at least in my experience, plumbing is anything to do with the supply of water in and around the house. So that could be pipes for the water supply, like the hot and the cold water, or it could be connected to the heating or anything that runs off of that. So your shower, your bath, your taps, those are all part of the plumbing.M: And this is a very good example to give when you talk about something that you cannot fix yourself. Plumbing is spelt with plumbing. But we say plumbing, dear listener. And a person who fixes is called a plumber. And you can say it like, if there is something wrong with the plumbing at my home, I usually call in an expert. So plumbing is about water pipes in your building, in your house, in your flat. So everything with this, you know, like pipes and water, what else can break in your house?R: Oh, God, anything and everything. The windows could break, and you have to call in an expert to replace them unless you can replace your windows yourself. I don't know anyone who can do that.M: Air conditioning.R: Yeah. The various pieces of furniture could break. Your computer could break.M: Yeah, the internet, for example. Wi-Fi connection.R: The entire internet could break.M: No, no. What kinds of help do we usually ask for? So we ask for what?R: Effective help.",

I'm rarely in that much of a rush, and if I am, I can just hail a cab.

So we're talking about three years ago. Oh, wow, that was a long time ago.M: Is it difficult to learn to ride a bicycle?R: I think at first it is, yeah, because, well, I mean, for example, children need stabilizers, and I was no exception in this pattern.

There's some kind of regularity about it.M: Like colours, lines. For example, it had a beautiful pattern, or it had floral pattern. If you had flowers on your bicycle, my bicycle had a floral pattern.R: Did your bike have a floral pattern?M: No. It was just, it was like, sky blue. A very simple bicycle. Yeah, like a cheap bicycle.R: That's fine, though.M: Ooh, and I didn't have a bicycle for a very long time, I used other people's bicycles. And only I think at school, maybe in like secondary school I got, like, I was given a bike.R: I feel like it's a very European thing, though, to have a bike when you're a child. I imagine people in a lot of parts of the world don't have this. So it's a weird contrast.M: I think it's so very popular now, like, everybody has a smartphone. Pretty much everybody has a bicycle, especially a child. Like small bicycles, I think they are very popular.

Like, are you stupid with your stupid questions? No, I think, like, do you laugh a lot? I mean, like, do you laugh every day? Cause some people are very, you know, happy, they ha-ha all the time, and some people don't laugh every day. And actually, laughing is good for your body. It's good for your well being, mental health. There is some research, dear listener, from British scientists, and they say that laughter is good for your mental health. So you should laugh every day. Like this.R: Well, then that's not a lot, is it? That's laughing the normal amount.M: Yeah. Okay.R: Who decides these things? I demand to know.M: We don't know. You laugh, and also, you can make other people laugh. So if I make Rory laugh, I tell a joke and Rory goes like... Like this.R: I would not go like that, but okay.M: Rory will start laughing, dear listener. You can say I enjoy making other people laugh. I like making other people laugh. What is to be hard-pressed to do something?R: If you're hard-pressed to do something, it just means that it would be an action that's difficult to perform. I mean, if you ask someone, do they like laughing, then you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who says no to this question. It would be difficult to find someone who says no to this.M: To be hard-pressed is an adjective, which means having a lot of difficulties doing something.

And look what happened. Exactly that. I suppose that was inevitable, really. I didn't have any pipe dreams like being a footballer or anything like that.",
    discussion:
      "M: Hey, dear listener, childhood! The time when you were a child. And you know, like a child, how old is a child?R: How long is a piece of string, to be honest with you? I would say it goes from being born until you're, what, like, reach the age of majority. So that could be 16 in some countries. In other countries, it's 18.M: Yeah, dear listener, so kind of our childhood. You know? Like when you were a child.R: When you were younger than you are now.M: Yeah, pretty much. Like, you know... You are 30 today. You know, last year it was childhood. Like 29. Childhood. you can say like, oh, I'm still a child, you know? So, yeah, some strange questions. Like, did you enjoy your childhood? But what if you didn't enjoy your childhood, Rory? Can I say, like, no, I was very unhappy in my childhood. Everybody bullied me.R: To be honest, that I was very tempted to say, like, no, I didn't like being child, actually, I hated it. But I think it's good to put a positive spin on these things. So I just said, not as much as my adulthood, which is now I'm an adult, allegedly.M: Yeah, dear listener. So it's much better to say a couple of positive things about your childhood, but if you want, you can say like, oh, no, I hated my childhood, but this would make the examiner uncomfortable, I think. We can say that, yes, I enjoyed my childhood. I enjoyed being a child. I did a lot of drawing and reading, I did a lot of reading. Our Rory is a writer, and he did a lot of reading when he was a child. You know? Other popular activities in our childhood are board games. Maybe you played board games, or you rode your bicycle. Maybe you did sports. You played hide and seek, dear listener. You know, like this game, when everybody has to hide and you have to find them, hide and seek. Or like you did puzzles. Maybe you did a lot of jumping on trampolines, like, boom, boom, boom.R: We had a trampoline in our garden, actually, now I think about it. How dangerous is that?M: You can also say that I did a lot of outdoor sports. Okay? I played a lot with my peers. We have childhood and we have adulthood. So if you enjoy being an adult more, you can say, I enjoy my adulthood more. So we have childhood and then adulthood. Nothing in between, Rory?R: I think you could call that your adolescence. But there is some debate as to whether that's actually a real thing.M: Adolescence. Yeah. An adolescent is a teenager. Adolescence? Like the time when you are a teenager and you can say, yeah, I enjoy being an adult more because I like the freedom of action. Adults have the freedom of action. We can do whatever we want. Scotland. And we have greater responsibility.R: But that just means we have to do more things. But I like that. I like being responsible.M: Yay! But if you don't like it, you can say, well, I enjoyed my childhood because I hate this responsibility and I hate this freedom because it's very difficult to choose what to do. And you have to decide what to eat every day. Dear listener, every single day of our life we are thinking, we think about what we'll eat.R: Is that much of a difficult decision to make?M: Yes, sometimes it is.R: Is it? No... It's easy.",

Or things with your free time.M: Yeah, when I have the time. Yeah, when I have the time, I go jogging, for example. And dear listener, free time is important for our sense of self-worth, okay? So, like we love ourselves, we take care of ourselves, yes, and free time is important. Free time, outside of work. So to kind of, to get in touch with yourself, to find a good work-life balance, dear listener. All right? So you should develop a routine that allows you to have some spare time. Is also another synonym. So leisure time, spare time and to have the time for something. So what does Rory do? I do a lot of exercise. I do yoga. I do weight lifting. Okay?

I mean, most books are quite chilled out. The last book I read was a bit of a roller coaster.M: Can I say that I balance out dancing with reading?R: Yeah.

He's quite encouraging and gives clear instructions and sets equally clear expectations, which has been very helpful.M: Are you still in touch with your primary school teachers?R: No, I'm afraid I didn't really get on with the vast majority of them at the time, and I think they'd also probably appreciate a quieter existence without being bothered by their former students asking after them. I do hear about them occasionally, though, but I don't go out of my way to do that either.M: Do you have a teacher from your past that you still remember?R: Yeah, my favourite teacher in primary school was Mrs Jones.

It's a shame I only had her for a year.M: Do you want to be a teacher in the future?R: Well, I hope so, since I am one now and it's panning out well so far.

    discussion:
      "M: Hey, dear listener, teachers! Did you like school? Do you like teachers? They're everywhere. So my favourite teacher. Rory told us about his yoga teacher. You can speak about your primary school teacher. Primary school? When kind of you go to school, and you go to primary school and then secondary school or high school. My high school teacher was the best, or maybe your, I don't know, English teacher, your swimming teacher, your yoga teacher. What other teachers do we have in the world? Like cooking teacher.R: Oh, anyone who helps you do anything. Yeah, cooking or...M: Music teacher.R: You already mentioned swimming teacher. You took the good ones. Yes. Music teacher. Maybe you have a singing coach. So a coach could also be a kind of teacher as well, if you do any sort of sports or activities that need one of those.M: Yes, dear listener, you can also talk about a coach. Like a football coach, like a trainer. So a trainer, a coach, a teacher. What other words do we usually use? Therapist.R: Is a therapist a teacher?M: He's not, huh? He's like a doctor, therapist. Psychologist, psychiatrist. So...R: Maybe, maybe a speech therapist is like a teacher, because they have to teach you how to speak.M: A speech therapist. Ooh, yes. And also, if I learn some, like if I learn how to speak publicly, it's not a speech therapist, but like a voice instructor.R: Or a public speaking coach.M: Public speaking coach, dear listener. You see? So you don't have to speak about teachers from school, okay? Like make up some singing teacher, speech therapist, and then you should describe them. So my favourite teacher is charismatic. They have charisma. And knowledgeable. Knowledgeable? They know things.R: What is charisma?M: What is charisma? Hmm, it's this, you know, special energy of a person, charisma. Charismatic. Ooh, it's C2 word. Charismatic - used to describe a person who has charisma.R: Is it? Look at me using these C2 words without even knowing them.M: Charisma is a special power that some people have naturally that makes them able to influence other people and attract their attention and admiration. For example, Rory is charismatic. He's got charisma, so people are attracted to him. So Rory, you use this word lord something over you?R: Yeah, it's an idiom. But that means behaving like you're better than or superior to another person. Usually, the person you're talking to.M: So the idiom is lord it over someone. To behave as if you are more important than someone and have a right to tell that person what to do. So kind of usually teachers think that they are more knowledgeable, smarter than you are, so they like to lord it over us. Rory, could you use this idiom in a sentence about teachers, students, about school.R: Well, if you're a bad teacher, then you tend to, well, you know more... All teachers know more than their students. But if you're a bad teacher, then you lord it over your students, and that means you just behave like you are better than they are, which does not do much good for your relationship with people, usually. I don't think people like it very much.M: Can I say that I dislike teachers who lord it over people?R: Yes, or lord it over their students.",

That sounds like really mild compared to, compared to things like bungee jumping, but it's a lot, it's still something I thought was quite exciting when I was young.M: Has anything exciting happened to you recently?R: Oh, God, I don't really know... Oh, yes. I did lead climbing with my friend a few weeks back. That's a type of rope climbing where you take the rope with you, rather than have it prepared for you in advance. So if you fall, you can fall quite far, and actually, you could really hurt yourself. Other than that, honestly, I can't think of anything. I'm a very boring person with a very sheltered life, normally.M: Would you like to try scuba diving or bungee jumping?R: I've done both, actually.

Just a never-ending series of issues with this, with this house, which I love, I love you, house, but I just wish that it would be easier.M: Oh, my God, so dear listener, extreme activities. We are not talking about nice cooking at home. You know, we talk about rock climbing, scuba diving, when you put this tank with oxygen and you dive into deep waters. Snowboarding, surfing, white water rafting. Rafting is when you go to a river with a small boat, and you kind of... Like this.R: You've done that, I think, haven't you?M: Yeah, but the river was calm, so it was quite nice. Yeah, bungee jumping is when you just jump.R: And that's all. You just jump.M: Yeah. Bungee jumping is when you have a rope, which is usually, well, you are tied with a special thing, and you just jump off a cliff. It's crazy.R: Well, maybe not off a cliff, off a bridge.M: Yeah, off a bridge. Yeah. So you can say that I've done. So what have you done? And even if you haven't done anything, dear listener, just kind of speak about some activities. Imagine that you are Jason Statham. You've done everything in life. And for some reason, Jason Statham speaks like this. I'm Jason Statham, I've done everything in life.R: Has he been bungee jumping as well?M: Well, Jason has done everything, from bungee jumping, no, he's done bungee jumping from a motorcycle without any rope. Jason doesn't need a rope.R: What? Well, then that's not bungee jumping, that's just suicide.M: No, no, no. There's a film, and he just, you know, like he has his motorcycle and it's in the mountains. And he just, you know, like he's driving his motorcycle at a very high speed, and then bam, he just jumps from a motorcycle onto the train. Oh...R: That is crazy.M: Yeah. What a rush. What a rush. Rory, if we say what a rush, what do we mean?R: An adrenaline rush, which is the release of the hormone or the neurotransmitter which makes you have that rushing feeling when you're excited. I should say that's not what it's for, that's just the effect it has. I have no idea what it's for. It's probably to encourage you to be able to run away from things faster.M: Yeah, so you can say that I've done mountain biking or sky diving or bungee jumping, rock climbing. It was brilliant. What a rush, I felt the adrenaline. Rory told us that... Like he said, I've been cage diving with great white sharks.R: Is that perfect aspect?",

Yeah, pals like friends. It's more informal than friends. But pals, when we say pals, we mean girls or boys, right?R: Oh, yes. In the same way some people use the word mate to mean friend.

I feel like I've made a huge amount of personal and professional progress, so I don't need to go above and beyond all the time now.M: What subject do you think is the most challenging at school?R: In my case, it was mathematics, which is ironic, because the only A grade I've ever been given in my life was for that subject. I don't think it was maths itself that was the issue. It was just the way it was taught and the conditions it was taught in that put me off and made me see it as a chore.M: Do you like to live a life that has a lot of challenges?R: I certainly used to when I was younger and had more energy and wanted to get a lot done, but now I have a rather well balanced existence. My only real challenges come from organizing my time around my various work commitments and goals. So I wouldn't say it's overly challenging. If anything, it's a pretty easy life.M: How do you usually deal with challenges in daily life?R: Well, I won't lie, I often like to have a little bit of a rant to myself or my friends to express my annoyancewhenever I'm faced with something challenging, and then I just get down to business and deal with it. So usually, when a problem comes in, I'll sigh and make a snide remark, and then I'll start on the solution to overcome the issue or challenge. That's just my process.",
    discussion:
      "M: Right, dear listener, what about you? Do you enjoy challenges? No, not so much? And there is a verb, to challenge. So we can challenge ourselves. So not to be like all lazy and do nothing, but to do new stuff, like, yay, I'm gonna learn how to speak Chinese. I'm gonna climb mountains and swim under ice, in icy waters. And you can say I used to love a challenge, but not anymore. So in the past, I loved challenges, but now, not so much. I'm quite content with what I have now. I'm quite glad with what I have now. Coast through life, Rory. Coast. Coast is like, like the ocean. Ocean coast?R: Well, it can be, but also, if you're coasting, it just means that you're going by just on inertia or the energy that you built up beforehand without making any effort yourself.M: So to coast is to move down a hill or a slope without making any effort.R: Yeah. So the situation is carrying you, rather than anything you do.M: And you can say that I feel like I've made a huge amount of personal and professional progress. I've made some progress, so I think I don't want any more challenges in my life. I don't need to go above and beyond all the time. So I don't need to challenge myself all the time to do something like crazy all the time, to do something new. So go above and beyond. It's an idiom which means to do more or better than would usually be expected of someone. For example, you go to work and your colleagues go above and beyond. So they do their work super well, so they do more than is expected of them. Or usually in sport. So I play football and my teammates go above and beyond. Rory, could you give us another example with this, go above and beyond?R: Well, people frequently go above and beyond at their work just by working longer hours, because that's more than is expected of them.M: Subjects at school. Maybe mathematics was the most challenging, the most difficult, the most dreadful ever, or biology or literature, dear listener. So here, it depends on you. Or chemistry, or just say any subject you want. Just feel free to lie, but careful mathematics or maths. Maths was really difficult, I struggled with maths, it was difficult for me. Or maths was the issue. And maybe the way biology was taught was the issue, was the problem, so the way literature was taught, or the teacher was the issue. Aad it put me off. Like... I kind of, I started disliking it. So it put me off.R: And that would be good. If you're put off something, then you don't want to do it. So that can be... That can also be a response to a challenge.M: Yeah, I started disliking it. I was discouraged from liking it, like the way biology was taught put me off. So it was difficult, I struggled with it. I live a life full of challenges. Or maybe you don't, dear listener. Do you? No? If you had many challenges in the past, you can say I used to have many challenges, but now I don't usually go above and beyond all the time. You can also say that when I was younger, I had more energy and faced many challenges, but now not so much. I have a rather well balanced existence. Existence? Like life. And Rory, what do you mean by well balanced?R: Not too many challenges.M: Like a good balance between work and life, challenges and like not doing anything.R: And then we have the real challenges. So if something is a real challenge, that's like a proper challenge for you. Other things might not seem to be challenges.",

I don't particularly enjoy it, but I don't mind doing it to check that I'm presentable.M: Have you ever bought mirrors?R: Well, luckily, my apartment came with its own, so really I shouldn't have had to, but I did have to buy a small vanity mirror for the bathroom and a full body one for my bedroom, just to make getting dressed slightly easier.M: Do you usually take a mirror with you?R: Not really. I can always quickly check my appearance in the reflection of windows or other surfaces, and it's not a big deal, but then I don't wear makeup or anything that needs a bit more precision, so it's easy for me.M: Would you like to use mirrors to decorate your room?R: I wouldn't say they were decorative things, to be honest, I'm a more practical person, so I have one opposite my wardrobe to make it easier to see how an outfit is working. I have seen ornate mirrors, but they've been in museums or other public places like that, not in homes.",
    discussion:
      "M: Hey! Mirrors. So dear listener, what a strange topic. So welcome into the weird world of IELTS topics. Mirrors. Do we have any synonyms for a mirror?R: No, I think, I think that's all it is. It's like the concrete object. What else could you have? I don't know.M: But we can use different names for mirrors, like we have different types of mirrors.R: Yes. We've got full body mirrors, vanity mirrors. What other ones? I think you can have mirrored doors to different wardrobes, for example. So you can see yourself after you take the clothes out.M: Wall mirrors, also like a wall and a mirror, and also like over-the-door mirrors. Like mirrors on doors.R: Yes.M: Yeah. We can also have, like custom-designed mirrors. Like beautiful mirrors. Yeah. And what is a vanity mirror?R: Um, I think... Well, the way I see it, it's just a mirror that you use to check your appearance when you apply makeup, or it's, it's directed at the face or the upper part of the body. So I have a small one in my bathroom and a large one, now that I think about it, actually.M: So dear listener, you can go to the IKEA website and take a look at different types of mirrors. All right? Remember, well, one or two names. Maybe you have, like, elegant furniture mirrors, or at home, you have antique mirrors. You know, like old, beautiful mirrors. Or maybe walnut mirror. Walnut is this nut, the kind of material that your mirror has or doesn't have, you can imagine. And when we talk about mirrors, we look at ourselves in the mirror. Okay? So I look at myself in the mirror. And if you do it too often, you could sound narcissistic.R: Yeah, but that's just a way of describing people who are obsessed with the, well, the external appearance rather than, well, not obsessed with but balancing that with being a good person internally as well.M: So a narcissistic personality has too much interest in themselves. So they admire themselves. A person is a narcissist. Someone who has too much admiration for themselves. Okay? Well, it's kind of like a negative thing.R: Well, it's definitely a negative thing.M: And we can say that, well, yes, I use a mirror to check if I'm presentable. So I look at myself in the mirror to check if I'm presentable. Presentable? Like, do I look okay?R: Yeah, reasonable. Not like fabulous, not...M: Yeah.R: Beautiful or gorgeous, but just presentable. You can go out in public and it's okay. You don't have messy hair, or maybe your makeup is on your face. I don't know how that works.M: Yeah, I look at myself in the mirror to check if I don't have messy hair, or to make sure I look presentable. So I'm good enough in the way I'm dressed. So I make myself presentable in front of a mirror. We buy mirrors for our apartments, flats, houses. And here you can say something about a small vanity mirror in the bathroom, a full body mirror in your bedroom, even if you don't have any mirrors at home, just lie. And you can say, when I get dressed, it's easier to look at myself in the mirror. And then you can say that, ooh, I have some round mirrors. So like shapes. You know? Maybe framed mirrors. Like a mirror, and then there's a beautiful frame, okay? Or maybe, a rectangle mirror. So what is a rectangle mirror?R: It's in the shape of rectangle. But you are the resident mirror expert, because I didn't know that was the thing until you said it.",

I suppose, once you master the basics like how to stay afloat on the surface and how to do the different strokes, then it's fine. Though, I imagine some have more difficulties than others. Looking back, it seemed pretty easy to me, but that could just be my memory being selective.M: What's the difference between swimming in the pool and swimming in the sea?R: Oh, wow. There's like a world of difference. A pool is mostly a warm, controlled environment with good supervision and lots of people to share the space with, but an open body of water has currents and various kinds of wildlife to contend with. So it could be less safe. Although there are fewer people, which I consider a plus.M: Where do people in your country like to go swimming?R: Well, wild swimming really seems to have taken off big time here. So you see people in the rivers and the sea more, maybe not at this time of year, but in general. But we also have lots of public baths for those who prefer something longer lasting, or who want to make a day of it. I can't really think of anywhere else.",

So Rory goes to the wild swimming club, all right? Once a week.R: I try. I've been good so far this year, but we are recording in January. We're recording halfway through January. Things could change.M: For Rory, it's a fun social experience. So he talks to people. He hangs out with people. It's kind of a social thing. So if you go to a swimming club, it could be a social experience for you. Like talking to people, meeting new people, go wild swimming together.R: Where else can we go swimming?M: Yeah, where else? So a pond is like smaller than a lake. A pond.R: Oh, it's a lot smaller. Can you go swimming in a pond?M: Yeah.R: Oh, my God, maybe you have bigger ponds in Russia.M: Yeah, yeah. So there are smaller ponds, bigger ponds. A lake, usually, a river, ocean. I swim in the ocean, I swim in the sea, dear listener, the article, the. Or do I say I swim in the river or in a river?R: I don't think it makes a difference, apart from if it's the first time we're talking about it, then you would say, I swim in the river. And then the next time you talk about it, I swim in the river. Or maybe both of you and the person you're talking to share the same context. And there's only one river. For example, where I live, there's a giant river in my hometown. So if we say I swim in the river, clearly, we mean the big one.M: Yeah, but usually, dear listener, we say like, oh, I enjoy swimming in a river, in a river, but I enjoy swimming in the sea, in the ocean. What about the swimming pool?R: Well, if there's only one in the town that you're in, then the but if it's a big town, then many. Then you'd say a.M: I enjoy swimming in a swimming pool, a swimming pool. Or I go to the swimming pool, or I go to a swimming pool. Like every week, I go to a swimming pool. I live in a huge city. There are many swimming pools. So I go to a swimming pool. But in the sea, in the ocean. We learn how to swim, usually, when we are, well, children. You master the basics, dear listener, you master swimming, like you learn how to swim, you master the basics, the basic skills. You learn how to stay afloat on the surface. The surface? Like the surface of a river, the surface of the sea, and you stay afloat. So you kind of float in the sea, you know? You stay there. You don't go down like the Titanic. Afloat. You stay afloat. And then you do different strokes. Strokes like... Oh, fuck with your arms. And I think legs. What do you do with your legs?R: You kick your legs.M: Kick?R: Well, my understanding is that the strokes are what you do with your arms and the kicks are what you do with your legs. But I think it's just come to mean everything you do with all of your body parts. So for example, breaststroke is when you move your hands like a frog and you move your legs like a frog. But backstroke is when you're on your back and you move your arms backwards and you just kick your legs.M: And what about like, um, you know, like you swim like a dog with your, kind of, hands and legs, like doing like a dog.R: Doggy paddle.",

Maybe the old church in the town square in Piron, but not because of the church itself, just for what it adds to the scenery.M: Do you prefer living in an old building or a modern house?R: I actually really like old houses. I think they have more character, and they're much better put together than new ones, which they seem, well, at least, they always seem to fall apart more. My house is about 120 years old, so it was obviously built to last. I can't really say the same for the new builds nearby, they don't look so great.M: Do you think we should preserve old buildings in cities?R: I mean, assuming they're an important part of the heritage and not a danger or some kind of impediment to the people that live there, then, yeah, absolutely. It's like I was saying about houses before. They have and, well, add to the character of an area. And if you just allow people to build whatever they like in an area, then it can become this sort of hodgepodge of different types of architecture, and it looks pretty unsightly. At least in my opinion.M: Have you ever seen old buildings in the city?R: I mean, that depends on how you define old, but my hometown is around 900 years old. So you're basically tripping up over old buildings in places like that, aren't you? You've got Gothic-style cathedrals and medieval castles. Elsewhere you can see similar things, actually, like the Kremlin in Moscow.

You see this modern skyscraper which was built, I don't know, five years ago. But an old building, maybe it's 50 years old, 60 years old.R: I think the best way to think about it is, if it's older than you, then it's old.M: Yeah. Oh... Wow.

Like an old church. So maybe you want to see some old churches, or the pyramids. Are they their pyramids?R: Well, it depends. We talk about the pyramids, we usually mean the Egyptian pyramids, but there are other pyramids. There are pyramids in Latin America as well, or Central America, depending on how you define it.M: Yeah, in Mexico.R: Yeah. And I think in Peru too, or in that area of South America. Apologies if you are from that area and you have a pyramid and I didn't mention it.M: No, no, no, it's in Mexico.R: Just in Mexico?M: Yeah, in Peru, no. We have Machu Piсchu in Peru.R: That's also an old, well, city and group of buildings.M: Yeah, yeah, yeah, ancient, ancient. What's the most famous pyramid?R: I mean, I don't know. How do you define the most famous? I suppose, for Western people, it's probably the Pyramid at Giza, I think. Is that like the tallest or the biggest one?M: Yeah, yeah. This one, this one. Yeah. And it's like, um, the Pyramids of Giza, and it's the pyramids. Or, like, the Great Pyramid of Giza. So, dear listener, you can say that, yeah, I want to see the Great Pyramid of Giza in the future, or some old churches in, I don't know, Europe.R: Yeah. I don't... I think a lot of people don't really go around hoping to see old buildings. They might want to enjoy a town, and old buildings will be part of that, but it's not something that you go out of your way to see, at least not in my experience.M: Yeah. So maybe, like, um, university buildings, cathedrals. What else is old? I don't know, some...R: Well, the actual blocks of houses as well could be old. I mean, my... The block of apartments I live in is over 120 years old. That's quite old. That's sort of Victorian-era Europe.M: Really?",

And I've just taken out, and actually, I regularly take out books on loan from the local library too.M: Have you ever borrowed money?R: Oh, not in decades. I really hate the idea of being in any kind of financial debt to anyone, especially a bank, since it feels like they own your soul, even the mortgage was out of the question for me. And I avoid borrowing it from friends, since I think it can actually ruin a friendship as well, which is why I typically don't lend money to others either.M: Do you like to lend things to others?R: Provided it's not money, I have no issue with that. My friends are quite responsible people for the most part, and they tend to look after things. And I live with a lodger too, and I like renting a room to him, since I'm grateful for the company, not to mention the income from that.M: How do you feel when people don't return things they borrowed from you?R: Well, this is it you see. I'm a very orderly person, so when I loan things out, I expect them to be returned to their rightful place, and I keep track of that. So when people borrowed money from me in the past and they didn't return it when they said they would, it really put me out of sorts.

You know, like once I went to this very cold place, like minus 35 and I had to borrow some special shoes. Yeah. Or people borrow board games, video games, some kitchen appliances, like ice cream makers, bread makers, camping equipment. There you go. Travel gear, suitcases, for example, sporting equipment, bicycles, some specialized tools, like some woodworking tools, dear listener. Books. We borrow toys. We borrow musical instruments. Costly electronics, dear listener. Like cameras, drones. Oh, Rory, can I borrow your drone, please?R: I don't have a drone to borrow.M: No? Oh, yeah. Interesting. And also, dear listener, you can kind of like ask, like, oh, Rory, like can I borrow your lipstick?R: I do not have lipstick, but I think this used to be a thing. Maybe it's not a thing now. Did ladies not used to borrow makeup from each other when they were in the bathroom together or something like that?M: Yeah, all the time. Yeah.R: They still do?M: Absolutely. Absolutely, yes. So kind of like you borrow things for a very short time, like you're in the bathroom with your girlfriends, like, oh, can I borrow your lipstick? Okay, you take the lipstick, you put it on, and then you give it back right away. Or, like, uh, you are at home at your friend's house, and then kind of, oh, can I borrow your hair dryer? Hair dryer, you know? Or can I borrow, I don't know, a shirt, or can I borrow your fancy sunglasses? Yeah, or can I borrow, I don't know, shampoo or hand cream? Then you use it right away, and then you give it back. This also is borrowing. And very often we borrow books from other people.R: From the library.M: Ooh, we borrow books from a library. So we take out books from the local library. And kind of if you borrow some books from a library, you bring them back. We can also borrow money from our friends. What about a bank? If I go to the bank or I, kind of like, online, is it borrowing or I take out a loan?R: Well, you you can take out a loan or you can borrow money, but the idea of taking money from somewhere, from a bank, is the same, and there are different kinds of loan. Like a mortgage is one that you would use for really big like purchases and then paying them back over a long period of time. It's usually for houses. But that's not the only thing.M: Yeah, and Rory hates the idea of being in financial debt. A debt is a situation when you owe money.R: When you need to loan or pay someone back.M: Yeah, for example, I take $10,000 from Rory. And now it's my debt. I owe him this money. So I don't like financial debts. We say it debts. And I don't borrow any money from anybody, and I don't lend money to others, to other people, because I think it can ruin a friendship. It can destroy a friendship. The preposition is to, to lend money to others or to other people. And about lending, Rory is okay with lending things to other people, because his friends are quite responsible. So his friends always pay him back, return the money. And Rory lives with a lodger. Who is a lodger?R: A lodger is someone that pays to live with you, basically. So if it's someone living in property that you own, but you do not live in, then they are a tenant. And if it's someone who lives on your property while you live there, they're a lodger, is my understanding of it. I'm simplifying things.M: Or a roomer in the American English. A roomer or a lodger. Someone who pays for a place to sleep. So Rory, do you come to your lodge and say it like, give me my money, where's my money? Give me my money, or I throw you out. No? You don't do it? Give me my money.",

Especially in the winter, when it's really cold and you need to keep warm, and of course, you lose a lot of heat through having exposed head.

We wear hats. What else do we do with hats? We buy them. We keep them.R: I'm trying to think of what else we display them, perhaps, if they're like, if they look good.M: Yes, dear listener, and if you don't like hats, if you have only one cap, you should say that, yes, I like hats, and then lie and use all this lovely vocabulary. Because if you say like, well, I don't have any hats. I hate hats. Well, like, what will you talk about? The examiner needs vocabulary from you, and fluency and English. So here, imagine that you love hats. You're a hat maniac. Like hats, give me hats.R: If you're not a hat maniac, then we'll talk about alternative things that you can do. But it would be good to be interested in hats, or at least look at what you might call some of your hats.M: So Rory chose a boring approach. So when it's cold, I wear a hat.R: I didn't say when it's cold, though. I said when it's freezing.M: Ooh, freezing. It's very cold, freezing. But hats are for style. They're not for like, you know, to warm your head.R: That's not true. You can use them for practical purposes as well.M: There are two purposes, yes, practical and style. But I don't wear hats regularly, okay? Or also, the third reason is protection from the sun.R: Oh, really? Oh, well, I suppose, yeah. People wear like, wide-brimmed hats for sun protection. So the brim of the hat is the part that sticks out from your head, as opposed to the part that covers your head.M: Yeah, and sometimes we need to cover our face. So you need to have this like wide brims, brims. They surround the hat. So you can say that in summer I wear what hats? Hats with wide brims?R: Yes, or a sun hat, you could just say.M: No, no, no. Dear listener, you need this word brim. Okay? A hat with wide brims. And here you can Google, just go to Google Images and put down b, r, i, m, brims. So this is a part of a hat that sticks out. What kinds of hats? So there are different kinds of hats. And you should remember maybe two or three types of hats, not just a cap. I wear a cap. Well, it's boring and simple, like, okay, Rory told us I have a few baseball caps, like regular caps that boys usually wear, and a beanie. Rory, what's a beanie?R: Well, if a baseball cap is something that's tight fitting and has something sticking out the front of it, like in one direction, then a beanie is just something that is a bit looser. It's a thicker material, and it sits over your head. It's usually used to keep your head warm, I think. Some people wear it as a fashion statement, though.M: Yeah, a very popular kind of hat, a beanie or a beanie hat. Please google it, you need to see a picture. Okay? A beanie. A beanie hat or a beanie cap. A small hat. It fits closely to the head, and sometimes it's made from wool. It can be warm, or it could be just, you know, like a hat, and you wear it as a fashion statement, like, yeah, your super hat, you know, and then you go inside and you keep the hat on inside, like indoor glasses, your indoor hat, okay? And your hat could have a lot of sentimental value, Rory. Sentimental value meaning...R: Just it brings up memories or reminds you of a particular time in your life. Maybe it's important for... Not the money that you can sell it for or the money that you paid for it, but it's important for how it fits into your life and what it reminds you of.",

Even though I know that's a shade, I'd still consider it a colour.M: Do you prefer bright colours or dark colours?R: Oh, definitely dark ones. I have a huge collection of black and navy blue shirts. I have a nice dark green one too, actually. I'm not sure why. It just comes more naturally to me.M: Are there any colours that you dislike?R: I wouldn't say I hated any colours in particular. Though I'm not a huge fan of fluorescent colours in any great amount. I just find it a bit overwhelming. It's nice when it's just a hint of colour, though, to catch the eye, like at an event, for example.M: Are colours important to you?R: I mean, I have my preferences, but I wouldn't have a nervous breakdown if I didn't get to wear or see a particular colour. I sometimes coordinate colours or colour-code things. That's helpful, but it's not the be-all and end-all.M: What's the colour of your room?R: Which one? Most of the rooms in my home are magnolia, or at least the walls are, but the walls in my bedroom I had painted Oxford blue to let me relax and sleep better. The only exceptions are the window frames and the shelves, which are sheer white.",
    discussion:
      "M: Right, dear listener, colours. Hey! They are back.R: They are. Again.M: Yeah, quite a common topic. You know, in IELTS, speaking part one. Colours, your favourite colour. And Rory is a big fan of dark colours. He is in the dark, this Rory boy. I'm a big fan of dark colours. I'm a big fan of bright colours. I'm a big fan of yellow. Or what other colours do we have? I'm a big fan of pale.R: Magenta.M: Magenta. What's magenta?R: Purple. It's just a fancy way of saying purple. No, I think magenta, as far as I'm aware, is bright purple. I could be wrong though, I'm not a big colour buff.M: It's reddish purple, magenta. Nice. You can say like, ooh, I'm a big fan of magenta colours. Or you can say that I'm not a big buff. What did you say? I'm not a big...R: Not a big colour buff. It just means that I'm not into colours.M: Yeah, because I'm not into colours, I just, I just wear black, that's all. And grey. You can say I enjoy different colours, especially blue or navy blue, or I've been known to wear brighter colours. So people know me and I wear brighter colours. I like different shades of black or different shades of grey. Remember the film? Or different shades of pink or red. We have bright colours and we have dark colours. All right?R: So if they're closer to black, then they are darker colours, but if they're closer to white, then they are lighter colours or brighter colours.M: And you can say that I have a huge collection of black and navy shirts.R: But that just means I have a lot of them. Navy blue.M: Yeah, like navy blue. So don't say just like blue, I like blue, say, like, okay, I like navy blue. Don't say that, oh, I like red or pink. Say I like magenta. And then you can say, like, I enjoy dark green or dark yellow, dark red. And I don't know why I like this colour. It comes more naturally to me.R: So that just means it feels natural.M: You can also say like this colour suits my face colour. It matches my face colour, or it matches the colour of my skin. I'm not a huge fan of fluorescent colours. You can say I'm not a huge fan of black or I'm not a huge fan of yellow. Or Rory told us about these fluorescent colours. This, you know, like bright...R: Neon pink or neon yellow. But even then, I just don't think, like having a lot of it is very pleasant to look at. That's just my opinion, though.M: I find such colours a bit overwhelming. Overwhelming? They're a bit, you know, too much, like all this pink and green and red. They're a bit overwhelming. It's nice when it's just a hint of colour, like not too bright, not too dark, a hint of colour to catch the eye. So colours catch the eye of other people.R: But that just means they get the attention of them.M: Yeah. Can I say, if I want to catch the eye of people, the eye of the public, people's eye?R: You could, I suppose.M: So, if I want to be the centre of attention, if I want to catch the eye, I would wear pink or red or different colours, different bright colours. I have my preferences, so I prefer dark colours. I have my colour preferences. But Rory is not like super enthusiastic about colours, so I wouldn't have a nervous breakdown if I didn't get to wear my favourite colour. Okay? So I'm just okay with colours. It's a nice phrase, like I wouldn't have another breakdown if I didn't wear my favourite colour all the time. I coordinate colours. So what do you do when you coordinate colors?",

      "Maria: Are you a patient person?Rory: I mean, I like to think so, yes, I'm generally pretty good at managing my emotions when people aren't doing what they should be. Of course, I'm not perfect. It's harder some times compared to others, like when I'm in a rush, then I'm probably less likely to have time for people.Maria: Are you more patient now than you were when you were a child?Rory: Yeah, I certainly think so. I feel like kids in general tend to need instant gratification. And it was no different when I was younger. Now that I've had a bit more life experience and cognitive development, it's definitely easier to hold myself in check.Maria: Does your job require you to be patient?Rory: I'd say it requires more patience on the part of my students than for me personally. My job is to find things that work for them. So if something doesn't work, it's easy for me to find alternatives. But for them, it could be quite a frustrating experience, especially to experience failure, since it's an investment of their time and money, and they want to do well.Maria: How do you feel when you have to do something for a long time?Rory: Well, I suppose that's contingent on what I have to do, really. If it's something I like, such as reading, then I don't really have a problem getting on with it. But if it's something I think is quite dull or pointless, then I get put off pretty quickly. And it's very evident that my heart just isn't in it.Maria: What is it that makes you feel impatient?Rory: Well, generally, when people waste my time, or rather when they can be perceived as wasting it, I have a lot to do in my life, and I don't like sitting around doing nothing if it can be helped. So when people get cavalier with my time, I tend to get annoyed fairly quickly.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: So, dear listeners, patient. Patient is an adjective, and this means that you have the ability to wait or suffer without complaining or becoming annoyed, or to continue doing something despite the difficulties. For example, you get stuck in a traffic jam and then like, oh, like I hate it, I'm getting annoyed, like, oh, you should be patient, you know... So, we are patient with people, you should be patient with her, or like the opposite, what's the opposite, if you are not patient?Rory: Impatient.Maria: Yeah, impatient, so I'm impatient with small children. And here you can say, I'm a patient person overall, or I'm generally pretty good at being patient. Or here we're talking about managing your emotions, anger, anxiety, these are our emotions. You can say, I'm pretty good at managing my emotions, or I'm not good at managing my emotions.Rory: I always think it depends on the time of day and the situation. Oh, in fact, I remember reading about this. They did a study with federal judges in America, and if they did not eat before they gave sentences to criminals, then the sentences were much harder.Maria: Oh, yeah.Rory: So, this just goes to show, being hangry is a real thing, so if you want to be patient, then you should definitely avoid being hungry when you have to make decisions.Maria: Yeah, it's like hangry, to be angry and hungry. Yeah, no, no, not a good combination. When I'm in a rush, when I have to do something really quickly, I'm rushing about, like, oh, I don't have time, this, so when I'm in a rush, I usually get really impatient. You remember that when the examiner asks you something about your childhood, you say, I used to. So, I used to be a very patient child, or a super impatient child. I really enjoyed how you said it. Now, I've had more life experience, and I've had more cognitive development. Nice. What do you mean, cognitive development? Have you developed cognitively?Rory: Yes. So, you have patterns of thought in your head that you've created over time and through experience that allow you to cope with situations much better than before.Maria: Yeah. How effective they are is a matter of opinion. And now it's easier for me to hold myself in check.Rory: That just means to have control over yourself and your emotions.Maria: So, hold something in check, or hold myself in check. For example, I've learned to keep my temper in check. Like, temper, like how angry I can get. My job requires me to be patient, or doesn't require me to be patient. So, it requires, like, I have to be patient. And sometimes it could be quite frustrating.Rory: So, when you're frustrated, you're trying to do something, but you're failing to do it.Maria: Yeah, it's actually C1.Rory: Oh my gosh. Okay, I was thinking that would be like B2, band 6.Maria: No, no, no, C1 would, yeah. So, making you feel annoyed. Like, my job could be frustrating. It makes me feel annoyed, less confident. I can't achieve it. Like, I'm trying and trying to get a band 8 for writing, and I can't do it. So, it's really frustrating. So, I could get impatient, or like, usually I get impatient when I'm frustrated or something is frustrating. Being patient, or having patience, means being able to wait calmly in the face of frustration. And when you have to wait for something for a long time, when you do certain activities which take a long time, you should be patient, ideally. And that's why the question is, like, about activities, what you do for a long time, like, what's going on. And here Rory says: That's contingent on what I have to do. Meaning, that depends on what I have to do. That's contingent.",

Not everything has to be so resource-intensive, does it? I don't know if they need to do it, but it's certainly expected.Maria: On what occasions do you say thank you?Rory: Oh, wow. It would be easier to say when I don't, to be honest. I always try to be polite to people, especially if they help me out, even in a minor way. And so that could be anything like when they hold the door or let me pass them in a street with minimal fuss.Maria: Do people in your country often say thank you?Rory: I think so.

I have no idea.Maria: Have you ever sent a thank-you card to others?Rory: Oh, God. Well, I must have at some point, I suppose, though I can't remember exactly when. I think it might have been when I left… Yeah, I left one of my friends after she let me stay with her for a few weeks, and that was really nice of her. So I think I probably sent something then. And if I didn't, I would have at least given her a goodbye present. And if not, then I can say it now. Thank you, Cheeway, for letting me stay with you when I was in Kyrgyzstan doing different things.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: So, dear listener, yeah… Thank you! Do you like this topic? A very interesting topic…Rory: It’s a weird one!Maria: It is a weird one, yeah…But it’s universal, and I think everyone all over the world says “thank you” at least once in their life, right? I think we do say thank you every day, huh? We do it every day. Do you, dear listener? Actually, it's a good meditation practice. Before you go to sleep, you should thank somebody or be thankful for what you have and pronounce it out loud or to yourself. Yeah, so we say thank you. And an adjective, Rory, what's an adjective from thank?Rory: To be thankful.Maria: Yeah, we are thankful and the preposition for something?Rory: Yeah, you could also be grateful and show gratitude for something. It occurs to me that I didn't quite say that.Maria: Another synonym is be grateful. So I'm so grateful to you. I'm so thankful for. And thanks is an expression of gratitude. So when you say thank you, you express your gratitude to someone. It's a nice way to show that you appreciate something. So you like something, you value something, you appreciate something or someone. So, someone has done something for you, and you appreciate it. So you are grateful, and you express your gratitude. And without any commitment of buying something like a gift. So no gifts, we use words. On what occasions do you say thank you? Like, when, after what do you usually say thank you? Occasions like events or situations. And Rory lives in Scotland. He's from Scotland, so he's pretty much British, and we know that in those countries, people usually say thank you, thank you, thank you. Sorry, sorry, sorry. So these are like two words - Thank you, and sorry that they might overuse them, they use them far too often.Rory: How often is too often?Maria: Hmm, a good question. Yeah, but it depends on the country, right? In certain countries, people say thank you all the time for nothing, right?But in other countries, they don't. And I'm usually quite… I find it rude if a person doesn't say thank you when I give a present, for example.Rory: Yeah, you should say thank you.Maria: Yeah, but some people don't. It's just rude. Like what? Like, I give you something, even if you don't like it, at least say thank you. So don't do that, dear listener. If someone gives you something, just say thank you. To be polite, you see, to be nice, to be friendly. So if a person helps out, so if a person helps me out, helps me, I usually say thank you. And then you can give some examples. If a person holds a door for me. So you are entering a shop and then a person holds the door for you, you say thank you. Or if they let me pass them, right?",

    discussion:
      "Maria: Yay. So, dear listeners, encouragement. Encouragement means words…Rory: …words we use to tell people they did a good job or they did something right.Maria: Yeah. Like we praise people, we encourage people. When you praise someone, you say like, yeah, well done, you, good job. So we express our admiration and approval of their achievements. So I praise him for his honesty, for example. And that's why some questions could be about achievements. What have you achieved? Have you had any achievements? Or like “praise someone for something”, right, for doing something. I feel pretty elated when I'm praised. So elated means happy, extremely happy and excited. Actually, elated is a C2 word, yay, Band 9 word. So I feel elated by the praise. I'm ecstatic, you can also say. I feel ecstatic, I'm over the moon, I'm super happy and I feel pleased with myself. So it's nice to be recognised. So when people praise you, it means that they appreciate what you are doing, they recognise…Rory: Tell you you did a good job.Maria: Yeah, they kind of recognise your effort and achievements. The last time somebody praised me. So the last time when someone told you, like, you've done a good job or well done you. And then you can use like, oh, I think it must have been last week when I was at the gym. Like probably it was when I was at the gym. So it must have been…Rory: …or it might have been.Maria: …last week at the gym or it must have been the other day at the gym or at school, at university. So kind of, I think probably it was. And then what were you doing? I was doing sports, I was swimming, I was doing a test and then something was amazing. Your friend did a good job and then you praised them, you encouraged or encouraged them.Rory: Or you gave them encouragement.Maria: I gave my friend some encouragement, yeah. And then the situation when you've been praised. So I've been praised or I've recently been encouraged by my teacher. My teacher praised me. And also we can use some models with the present perfect. I might have been praised last week or at the gym, or at school, like maybe they praised me at school. So I might have been praised last week, actually.Rory: But we're not sure. Yes, we should be… Well, we shouldn't worry too much about sounding uncertain, if you know, amazing. But it will not affect your score if you say that you're not sure, because this is how people communicate these ideas in real life. Plus I think past models like must have been are pretty advanced, right?Maria: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Band 9. Totally. So kind of like, have you ever been praised by a teacher? Well, I think so. I might have been at school when my teacher said that or when my teacher complimented how I did this task. So to compliment someone is a nice synonym, to praise. And we use this word as a noun, a compliment. So we pay compliments to people and to compliment.Rory: Compliment.Maria: Compliment. Yes. Actually, it's a C2 word.Rory: Oh, very nice.Maria: Hmm. Yeah. So kind of pay compliments to people and as a verb, to compliment somebody on something. So he complimented me on…",

I have a pretty fixed one, since I tend to buy the same things every week. You'd think that would make it easier to remember, but I always have it on hand, just in case.Maria: Do you prefer to make a list on paper or on your phone?Rory: It depends on what it's for. If it's shopping, then my phone is fine, since I have to carry that around with me and have a free hand for picking up what I'm shopping for. But for things like travel, I prefer to have it written out by hand in my diary so I can refer to it as I go. I think that also makes it easier to remember.Maria: Do you make a list for your work?Rory: Yeah, I mean, I write lesson plans, which are essentially checklists of things I need to remember when I'm working with students. They're pretty basic, but it helps me keep track of everything to make sure we can work together effectively.Maria: Why don't some people like making lists?Rory: Well, you'd have to ask them. But if I were to speculate, I suppose they might not like the accountability or the mental heavy lifting that comes with doing something they're not used to. No one likes difficult things, do they?",
    discussion:
      "Maria: So, dear listener, we make lists. A list is a short piece of information. It's not a piece of paper. No. It's kind of a list of different things. A shopping list, for example. And the preposition is ON. Something is on the list. Is my name on the list? Oh, you are on the list, not in the list. What other verbs do we use? Make lists, write up lists?Rory: Put a list together?Maria: Put a list together, yeah. You can have a fixed list. I have a fixed shopping list, and I tend to buy the same things every week. And I have a fixed shopping list on hand. So I have it handy, I have it close, I always have it with me. We can make a list on paper, or I can make a list on my phone. Or I have a digital list, for example.Rory: I used to write down lists on the back of my hand so I wouldn't forget things.Maria: You can also say this. I used to write lists on the back of my hand. Yeah, so if I go shopping, I have a shopping list on my phone. On my phone. Or sometimes I prefer it written out. So I prefer to write down things, I prefer to write them in my diary, or in my daily planner. I prefer to write it down. I prefer to have it written out for me. I usually make a list for work, or I have different lists for my work. And I usually write up checklists of things I need to remember. So I usually have a checklist for different things, or a list for each day of the week, for example. A list for my life. And they help me keep track of everything that I should do. So keep track of things. So these lists help me to keep track of my work.Rory: And if you keep track of things, you understand where they are and what's happening with them.Maria: Some people dislike making lists. And also, dear listener, you can say that I dislike making lists, or I never make any lists. But the topic here is about making lists, so you'd better like it. Or you lie, dear listener. You say like, yeah, I usually make lists for everything. People could think that making lists is mental heavy lifting. Rory, what do you mean by mental heavy lifting?Rory: It just means that it's difficult to… Or something that's difficult to do with your brain. So if it's a challenge for you to organise your thoughts and ideas, you might consider that mental heavy lifting, because it's hard for you.Maria: So in the gym, you do weight lifting. You go to the gym and you lift the weights. And here, Rory talks about mental heavy lifting. But do you mean that writing lists is mental heavy lifting? Is it mentally difficult?Rory: Yeah, well, the idea of organising what you need to do in your head might be difficult. Some people really struggle with this. I don't. Well, I don't know. I think I did when I was younger, because I didn't really understand what to do. And some people never get past that experience of finding it difficult to organise things. So they just don't. That doesn't make them bad people. It just means they're a bit disorganised.Maria: You can also say that some people find it tedious, like boring. They don't like to be restricted. Because when you write up a list, you kind of restrict yourself. But they want to be free, do what I want to do. So they want to be spontaneous. There you go. And if you make a list of things, you kind of have to do it. And you can also say that people dislike to-do lists. So a shopping list, a to-do list. So, a list of things to do, which is a reminder for you to do something. And also, we have the phrase a bucket list. Or is it the bucket list?Rory: Individual bucket lists would be a bucket list. But if you talk about a specific one, then it will be the.Maria: So my bucket list, a list of things that I would like to do before I die. Yeah, Rory, do you have a bucket list?Rory: No, because I've done everything that I wanted to do. I have one last thing to do. And that's it, really.Maria: What is it?Rory: I want to go to Slovenia to visit Piran. And that's all.",

    conversation:
      "Maria: Do you like singing?Rory: I like it when no one can hear me. I'm convinced I can't really hold a tune or stay in key. So it's a bit embarrassing and maybe uncomfortable when people have to listen to it.Maria: Have you ever learned how to sing?Rory: No, actually. I've learned how to speak properly and deliver lines, but singing is a bit beyond me at this point, which is a bit sad in some ways, because it would be a great way to entertain people, I suppose.Maria: Can singing bring happiness to people?Rory: Well, yeah, like I said, it's very entertaining, especially if you can incorporate it into some kind of act or performance. And it's fun to join in with big crowds, especially if it's a funny song.Maria: Who do you want to sing for?Rory: Ideally, no one ever. I find that idea mortifying. I might sing for my partner or my best friend if we made something up to make us laugh. But that's it. I'm no performer, for sure.Maria: Will you sing in the future?Rory: Privately, yes. I have no intention of going out there and singing for people en masse.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: Right, dear listeners, so first of all, we say singing. How do you pronounce it, Rory? Singing. Singing. Yes, it's not kind of like singing; it's singing. So no g g, no, singing. So I like singing, I'm into singing. I think Rory's got a lovely voice, but well, he doesn't like singing.Rory: But Maria often makes mistakes, and this is one of them.Maria: I'm fine with my singing, I'm fine with people disliking my singing, so it's okay. I like it when no one can hear me, you can say, or when no one is listening to my singing. I can't really hold a tune. So if you can't hold a tune...Rory: Well, it's just part of singing consistently and clearly. So if you cannot do that, then you can't hold a tune, and it doesn't sound very good.Maria: Or you sing out of tune. So usually I sing out of tune, so I'm out of tune.Rory: Or you could stay in key.Maria: So when you stay in key, you sing well and you understand the notes, you understand how your voice should work up or down. So the scales, or for example, like I can't sing on key, or it's difficult for me to stay in key. It's embarrassing. So I'm embarrassed by my singing, I'm not impressed by my singing, or it could be uncomfortable for other people to listen to it. Listen to, to listen to it. I've never learned how to sing, or I've never learned singing properly, like well. I've never learned how to deliver lines. And what do we do when we deliver lines? We just...Rory: We say them correctly.Maria: Yeah. To say lines of a song.Rory: Well, there is that, or it could be lines from a performance, like a play, for example.Maria: Singing is a bit beyond me. So I can't do it. It's not for me. I'm not able to do it. I don't have this… What do you call it? I don't have a musical ear?Rory: I don't know. It could be, if you don't have it, then you're tone deaf, but you might have an ear for music.Maria: Yeah, I don't have an ear for music, the audio listener. So I'm tone deaf, or I don't have an ear for music. Or you can say that, yes, I've learned how to sing. I went to this school, and they taught me. And then you say, I can hold a tune, I usually stay in key. My voice pitch is what? can we say about one's voice pitch?Rory: Well, the pitch is inconsistent or variable, I suppose, if it's not good. Or it's a good pitch, or pitch perfect, if it is good.Maria: I enjoy entertaining people with my singing. So when we get together, I usually sing for my friends. Singing can bring happiness to people. Yay! Because everybody enjoys a good singer. Singer, singing, it's really entertaining. So it's exciting, it's lovely. Everybody enjoys listening to nice music, right, nice voices. It's fun to join in with big crowds. So if lots of people start singing, you join in and it's fun. If it's a funny song or if it's your favourite song, yay! And everybody is united and happy. Yay! We usually sing for other people. And Rory finds this idea mortifying. Oh, it's mortifying. So it's dreadful.Rory: It's not good. Yes.Maria: Embarrassing. So Rory doesn't like this. But if you do like it, Rory, what can our listener say?Rory: Oh, I love it. It's amazing. I'm ecstatic when I'm singing. I feel fabulous. I don't know. All of these other good emotions. I find it terrifying or mortifying.Maria: I usually sing for my partner, for my family, for my friends, for everybody, or I just enjoy singing in the street. As I'm listening to music, I just sing things out loud. Or you can say that I'm no performer. So a performer performs on stage, sings or delivers lines like, I don't know, does stand-up comedy. So I'm no performer. Or I enjoy performing. I enjoy singing. Or, for example, you can say that I enjoy singing at karaoke. Maybe you enjoy karaoke. You can say that my vocal cords… Vocal cords, you have inside your throat. My vocal cords are not for singing. My ear is not trained. And you can say that singing gives us endorphins and dopamine.",

    conversation:
      "Maria: Do you like eating chocolate?Rory: Doesn't everyone? I probably like it a bit too much, if I'm honest. My protein shakes are often chocolate flavoured and even some of the bars I eat have similar flavourings. So I think it's safe to say that I really enjoy it.Maria: How often do you eat chocolate?Rory: Depends on the type. If we mean something like a milk chocolate bar, then maybe, I don't know, maybe like once a week. But if it's something with a chocolate flavour, then that's a daily occurrence.Maria: What's your favourite chocolate flavour?Rory: I really like white chocolate, actually, though I'm told it's one of the worst for you due to all the additives in it. I quite like mint chocolate chip as well when I have ice cream. That's a good combination, at least in my opinion.Maria: Is it good to use chocolate as gifts to others?Rory: Well, assuming you're not giving it to a diabetic, yes. Then again, you do get sugar-free chocolate these days, so maybe that wouldn't be so bad. It's easily accessible. This is chocolate in general is easily accessible. And if you're in a rush, it should be okay, like 99% of the time.Maria: Did you often eat chocolate when you were a kid?Rory: Yeah, again, probably a bit too much since I used to be a large child. But it was so nice, probably because it was packed with sugar.",
    discussion:
      "Maria: Chocolate. Mmm, hot chocolate. Yum, yum, yum. Dear listener, are you a chocoholic? Like, you know, shopaholic, chocoholic, like you love chocolate. You can say that I love eating chocolate. I just like chocolate. I'm a chocoholic. And if you like everything sweet, you can say I've got a sweet tooth. My protein shakes are often chocolate-flavoured. So Rory drinks these shakes, which are chocolate-flavoured. Or, for example, you can say my porridge is chocolate-flavoured, my coffee is chocolate-flavoured. What do you have in the morning? I don't know. My fruit is chocolate-flavoured.Rory: My fruit is chocolate-flavoured because my fruit is chocolate.Maria: My water is chocolate-flavoured. So if you add chocolate, something becomes chocolate-flavoured because it has this chocolate flavour, taste, chocolate taste. And I have some bars. So we call these little thingies chocolate bars, like Snickers, Nuts, Twix, the other ones, like chocolate bars, with similar flavourings. And what's the difference between a flavour and flavouring?Rory: Well, the flavour is what the actual thing tastes like, but flavouring is something that's used to make something different taste like that previous thing. It's like a cover, almost, that makes it look different or tastes different in this case.Maria: We can say like artificial flavourings, when they add something to food or drink. And we can say that I like chocolate flavour. When the examiner asks you how often do you do something, you can say I often, usually, rarely, hardly ever, like almost never, like once a week, twice a week, every day. And you can say that it depends on the type, because there are lots of chocolate types. We can have a chocolate bar, or a milk chocolate bar, or we can have like a hot chocolate, for example, to drink. And usually like once or twice a day, or once or twice a week. Really? You have like a chocolate bar once, twice a week?Rory: Maybe. I don't think it's a very common occurrence. No, unless the protein bars that are flavoured like chocolate count. But many people would say that doesn't count, that's a different product.Maria: And the question is like my favourite chocolate flavour is what? White chocolate, Rory told us.Rory: Although I realise that's the colour, but I think we all know what white chocolate tastes like.Maria: Or I like mint chocolate.Rory: Chocolate chip.Maria: Yeah, mint chocolate chip. Chip is like little thingies, like…Rory: Little chips of chocolate.Maria: And when I have ice cream, I usually ask for some mint chocolate chips. It's a good combination. If we talk about different chocolate flavours, for example, we can have spicy chocolate, or lavender chocolate. Lavender is this, what's lavender?",
